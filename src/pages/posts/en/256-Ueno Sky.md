**When Bitcoin Falls, I Reconsidered the Cathedral and the Casino**
<https://tw93.fun/en/2026-02-01/money.html>
Recently, Bitcoin dropped from its high of 120k to just over 70k, and market sentiment turned fearful again. Whenever the market falls, I find it easier to think about what's more like a casino and what's still building a cathedral. At the 2024 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett used "the cathedral and the casino" to describe capitalism, and this metaphor is especially useful at times like these. Violent price fluctuations mostly come from the casino side, while what truly determines long-term returns often requires years or even decades of sustained investment.

**My Minimalist Living Experience**
<https://tw93.fun/en/2024-03-03/simple.html>
I'd like to casually chat about minimalism. I really enjoy this lifestyle, but that doesn't mean everyone needs to be minimalist. Some people enjoy collecting, some like shopping and buying lots of things—any lifestyle that makes you comfortable is fine. But if you also enjoy a simple lifestyle, or if you have a bit of OCD, these small suggestions might suit you.

From starting to learn frontend development in college in 2014, to gradually open-sourcing some of my tools in recent years, I've made many friends and I'm very happy. Recording this milestone.

**Mole Recently Updated to Version 1.24**
<https://github.com/tw93/Mole>
This version is named Razor 🪒, an interesting name. Updates include the following, feel free to try it out:

1. mo clean - Smarter and Faster: Automatically empties trash via Finder, automatically handles locked files with fallback processing, batch deletion now uses find -delete for significant speed improvements, added Yandex browser and Apple Podcasts residual file cleanup, fixed progress bar remnant issues.
2. mo update --force: Even if already on the latest version, can force reinstall, automatically clears quarantine attributes so binary files can launch without security confirmation.
3. mo uninstall - More Thorough Residual Detection: Finds more residual files through lowercase hyphen, no-space naming variants, validates bundle ID format to prevent injection attacks, error messages more instructive.
4. mo check - Identifies Third-Party Firewalls: Prioritizes detection of Little Snitch, LuLu, Radio Silence and other third-party firewalls, fixes disk space parsing issues on non-English systems.
5. mo purge - Deeper Scanning: Maximum scan depth increased from 4 to 6 layers to capture deep build artifacts, automatically falls back to find when fd is unavailable, correctly handles circular symbolic links to avoid hanging.
6. Underlying Optimizations: Added operations.log for easier troubleshooting, app protection uses dual-array strategy reducing matching complexity from O(N) to O(1), Go scanner uses timer pool and channel timeout to prevent blocking.

**Codia AI NoteSlide Converts NotebookLM-Exported PDFs Directly to PPT**
<http://codia.ai/noteslide?r=tw>
I've really enjoyed using NotebookLM recently to help learn and understand new things, but it can only export PDFs, and sometimes the Chinese rendering isn't great. I've been looking for a good tool that can convert PDFs to editable PPTs, and after searching around, I found Codia AI NoteSlide works best. Compared to traditional pdf2ppt tools, it's much simpler and easier to use, quickly converts to editable content, and the results are beautiful, refined, and error-free. Very useful—if you have the same pain point, give it a try.

**Apple Battery Protection Tool - Battery**
<https://github.com/actuallymentor/battery>
This tool keeps your MacBook that's always connected to power at 80% charge, which supposedly extends battery lifespan. However, I mostly use it plugged in and don't pay too much attention to this, but those who need it can give it a try.

**Visual Status Alerting Tool for Developers**
<https://github.com/TwiN/gatus>
Gatus is a health dashboard for developers. You can monitor your services using HTTP, ICMP, TCP, and DNS queries, evaluate query results through a series of conditions (such as status codes, response times, certificate expiration, body content, etc.), and health checks can be integrated with various alert systems like Slack, Teams, PagerDuty, Discord, Twilio, and more.

**My 2026 Reading List**
I recently started selecting books for 2026 and picked these 5. Do you have any recommendations for the best books you've read this year? Feel free to recommend them with a brief explanation:

1. A Brief History of Intelligence
2. Chinese Painting: Yuan to Qing
3. Source Code - Bill Gates' First Autobiography
4. The Philosopher's Last Lesson
5. Nine Poetic Hearts: Literary Morning Star in the Dark Night

**How to Organize a New Year's Eve Team Building Activity That Young Engineers Love**

1. Don't hassle employees—help them apply for a half-day off on a workday, so they just come to play and eat.
2. Organizers prepare exquisite snack gift bags for everyone, with nice bags too, placed on dining chairs before arrival.
3. Play games young people enjoy, like XX points competition. Individual competition rankings get priority gift selection. To avoid gift exchange awkwardness, collect wish lists in advance without revealing names, so everyone roughly gets what they like. Even made a webpage to display it. For the top three, prepare a cute, presentable trophy, like engraved with "God of Gamblers," "Saint of Gamblers," "Knight of Gamblers."
4. For team competition, use the budget to prepare ten boxes of cherries, ten boxes of chocolate, ten boxes of strawberries from Sam's Club. Top three teams all get prizes per person, everyone smiling.
5. Don't choose hotel-style banquet venues for dining. Choose places that are delicious, clean, with good service, slightly 2 tiers above daily dining. Eat and drink well—no alcohol, but Coke, orange juice, coconut water all fine.
6. Finish eating at 7pm. Those who want to play organize activities themselves; those who don't, take their many gifts straight home. Keep it flexible and let people choose.
