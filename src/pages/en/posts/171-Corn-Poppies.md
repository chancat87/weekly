2. Bitcoin (12 BTC)
3. Gold (10 kg)
4. Nvidia stock (1000 shares)
5. Microsoft stock (2000 shares)
6. A small apartment in Beijing/Shanghai core district.
Which one would you bet on?

**Life Tip: try JD's laundry and shoe cleaning service**  
<img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/3x/144shots_so.png" width="800" />  
I've developed a habit of using JD's cleaning service every couple of months. it's incredibly satisfying to send out dirty shoes and get them back looking brand new.

it's cheaper and more convenient than local shops—around 39 RMB for 3 pairs of shoes, or 108 RMB for 5 pieces of clothing. JD Courier picks them up from your doorstep, sends them to their factory, provides a report, and delivers them back in less than a week. it saves time and brings a lot of "cleanliness joy"—a great example of high-value service.
