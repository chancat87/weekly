## 1. Trending Tools

**🎉 Mole: Dig deep like a mole to clean your Mac**  
<https://github.com/tw93/mole>  
Recently, my Mac storage space was a bit limited, and several tools I used didn't work well. During the National Day holiday, I wrote a simple Shell script for myself, and it suddenly cleared dozens of GBs of useless space. I've extracted some of those ideas into this tool and named it Mole. A mole is a small burrowing creature with very strong forelimbs, great at digging tunnels to find things. This tool can dig deep to clean your Mac. If you need to give your computer a spring cleaning, you can try it. It also supports thorough software uninstallation. **However, if your Mac is very important, it is not recommended yet; wait until Mole is more mature.**

**How to make your Mac Dock hide and show faster**
The first step I take with a new Mac is to hide the Dock and set it to appear quickly without delay upon hover, which is much more comfortable than the default effect. Enter these three commands in the terminal:

```shell
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.2
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0
killall Dock
```

**Subtitle Edit: An open-source video subtitle editor**  
<https://nikse.dk/subtitleedit>  
Found an open-source video subtitle editor called Subtitle Edit. It includes creating/adjusting/syncing/translating subtitle lines, intuitive synchronization/adjustment of start/end positions and speed, audio-to-text via Whisper or Vosk/Kaldi, and automatic translation. It's very feature-rich.

**Turn a command script into a native Mac app with Platypus**  
<https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus>  
If you want to turn a command script into a native Mac app, try Platypus. It's very simple to configure and package, which is perfect for sharing your command-line tools with non-technical friends. PS: I really like its logo.

**Helium: Very concise Chromium-based browser**  
<https://helium.computer>  
Helium, based on Chromium, is indeed very concise, fast, and light, with no extra fluff. It removes a lot of the "biased" stuff from Chrome. I like that its navigation and address bars are very narrow. Interested friends can play with it. Also, try the Maple series of extensions for bookmarks/themes/tabs; they work great together.

**MonitorControl: Tool for adjusting external monitor brightness**  
<https://monitorcontrol.app>  
Finally found a tool that can perfectly adjust external monitor brightness naturally. You can just use the original shortcuts, and it can even control the monitor's volume. It finally solved the problem of my monitor feeling a bit dim.

## Just Looking Around

**Found the funniest issue of the year**  
<https://github.com/Gar-b-age/CookLikeHOC/issues/81>  
Found the funniest issue of the year: a student from Anhui organized the "Lao Xiang Ji Ingredient Traceability Report" into a very clear Markdown open-source version called "Cook Like Lao Xiang Ji." It's very well categorized. Then, to thank him, the official Lao Xiang Ji account (thinking only the author could see issues) sincerely sent him a 1,000 RMB membership card, which was promptly snatched up by some heartless person...

**"mcp-for-beginners" by Microsoft is good**  
<https://github.com/microsoft/mcp-for-beginners/>
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) course for beginners is worth a careful read. Instead of just hearing the concept like USB, it's better to look at the system systematically.
