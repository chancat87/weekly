A small and beautiful macOS compression/decompression tool. Preview, extraction, compression, and sharing are all done in one step. Handles multiple tasks easily with a clean, distraction-free interface and a very smooth experience. I really like its icon design, though some may differ. Haha, to each their own.

## Just Looking Around

**"Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In" is so good!**  
<https://movie.douban.com/subject/36600459/>  
It's been many years since I've seen such a heart-pounding action movie. It could be called the best Hong Kong action film of the last 10 years. Extremely cool; friends who haven't seen it should go watch it.

## Random Thoughts

**Final solution for fixing your Mac**  
<img src="https://cdn.fliggy.com/upic/haz5ei.png" width="800" />  
When your Mac has problems requiring a fix—like a black screen not turning on, or if you can't update the system no matter what and Recovery Mode fails—you can try DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode as a final resort. It works very well.

You'll need another Mac computer connected via a USB-C cable. The auxiliary computer needs to use the port closest to the screen. On the Mac to be fixed, long-press the power button to turn it off. Install Apple Configurator on the auxiliary computer. Then comes the key part: on the Mac to be fixed, press and hold Right Shift + Left Control + Left Option + Power button for 10 seconds, then release the three keys EXCEPT the power button and keep holding it for about 7 seconds. It feels like pressing buttons on a slot machine; kudos to Apple for coming up with that. The DFU mode will appear in Apple Configurator on the auxiliary computer. Don't click "Restore" as it wipes the computer; find "Actions" -> "Advanced" -> "Revive Device" in the menu bar and wait.

This solution works wonders for final fixes of Mac system issues. You might want to bookmark it for future use.
