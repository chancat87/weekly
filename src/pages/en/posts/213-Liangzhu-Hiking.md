## Trending Tools

**Posting: An interesting terminal API testing tool**  
<https://github.com/darrenburns/posting>  
Found Charging on GitHub—a terminal-based API testing tool similar to Postman or Insomnia. Implementing this in the command line is indeed fun and convenient, and I love the color theme.

## Just Looking Around

**Guide to Quality of Life in Colleges**  
<https://colleges.chat/>  
This guide is well-organized, aiming to collect detailed information about universities worldwide that isn't explicitly mentioned in recruitment materials but significantly impacts quality of life. Using this with an LLM could be very helpful for graduates choosing a university.

**Carpe Diem: A Post from V2EX**  
<https://v2ex.com/t/1115174>  
Saw a post on V2EX—not that I'm interested in the Mini itself, but the reply "Buy it; it's rare to find something that moves you" really touched me. I want to slowly maintain this mindset: if something is needed and it moves me, and I can afford it, then I'll buy it. The older I get, the more I feel things shouldn't be left for "later," because the feeling won't be the same once you're old.

**The best recipe for "Sautéed Pork with Peppers"**  
Found the best recipe for sautéed pork with peppers! Friends should try it. This Jiangxi Pingxiang style has that exquisite taste I remember from childhood—very different from Changsha style and perfect with rice.

**You can never get rich by renting out your time**  
Rereading "The Almanack of Naval Ravikant" lately. It's a book that feels new every time, perfect for when you're stuck on certain thoughts.
