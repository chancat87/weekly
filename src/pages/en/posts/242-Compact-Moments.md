<small>The cover photo shows me making coffee at home over the weekend. I got a very nice-looking coffee puck—very flat and clean, compacted thoroughly. My OCD side really loved it, so I took a quick snap to use as the image for the Weekly.</small>

## Trending Tools

**🎉 Pake: One-click Web-to-Desktop App Packager**

**SwanLab: Deep Learning Training Tracking and Visualization Tool**
Found an open-source deep learning training tracking and visualization tool on GitHub called SwanLab. It provides a platform to track, record, compare, and collaborate on experiments, mainly for AI researchers. Designed with a friendly Python API and a beautiful UI, it offers features like training visualization, automatic logging, hyperparameter recording, experiment comparison, and multi-person collaboration. The visualization effects are very cool.

**Simple API call to send push notifications to your iPhone**
<https://bark.day.app/>
Bark is an open-source custom iPhone push notification tool relying on Apple APNs. It's timely, stable, and reliable, and won't consume device power. Based on the system push service and push extension, the app itself doesn't need to be running. Both source code and backend are open-sourced; you can use this capability to write custom notification tools.

**GitHub Copilot CLI Preview is out—A Value Choice**
<https://github.com/github/copilot-cli>
Recently, with Claude Code and Codex used up, I thought about the GitHub Copilot $10 Pro membership GitHub gave to open-source students. Just as the CLI preview version came out, I tried it, and it greatly exceeded expectations. The cost-performance is very high, supporting the use of Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 models. The overall experience is much better than the extension version of Copilot. Highly recommended for students considering cost-effectiveness.

## Just Looking Around

**My current AICoding priority selection**
I prioritize Claude Code ($20/month)—fast and decisive, like a young engineer. After it's used up, I switch to OpenAI Codex ($20/month), which is slightly slower but equally excellent. After that, I use GitHub Copilot CLI (free via GitHub, originally $10), which supports Claude and GPT-5 and is a great backup. Finally, my reserve is Grok Code Fast 1 ($25 top-up), with surprisingly high cost-performance. Paired with `claude-code-router` configuration, the experience is almost equivalent to a lower-spec Claude Code.

**Happy 1024**

1024. I modified some previously hand-written code into this. I wish that the code you write hereafter is always what you want to write—be a hacker and a painter.
