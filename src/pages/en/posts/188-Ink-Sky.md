**Beautiful chart library by shadcn/ui**  
<https://ui.shadcn.com/charts>  
My favorite UI library, shadcn/ui, has released a beautiful chart library. I love its pure, minimalist modern feel. it offers multiple color schemes and code snippets that are easy to copy and use.

**litegraph.js for graph-based node editors**  
<https://github.com/jagenjo/litegraph.js>  
I noticed ComfyUI uses `litegraph.js` for its node relations. it's very suitable for graph-based production scenarios. it has its own HTML5 Canvas2D editor and feels a bit more "industrial" than React Flow. both have their strengths.

**The LLM Triangle Principles to Architect Reliable AI Apps**  
<https://towardsdatascience.com/the-llm-triangle-principles-to-architect-reliable-ai-apps-d3753dd8542e>  
This is an excellent article that aligns with my understanding of AI app best practices. An AI app isn't just about the model—it's an intersection of engineering capability, LLM capability for the scenario, and business context.

**Random Talk: What is good design**

Good design should first be simple, problem-solving, and easy to use.
Good design should be timeless, inspiring, and even bold.
Good design should be reproducible, mass-producible, and widely praised.

**Random Talk: When to buy and sell stocks**

In stock investing, timing is often a pain point for beginners. It's easy to be swayed by fluctuations and make wrong decisions. I did some systematic study over the weekend and consolidated some notes here to share.

**Buy Strategies**

1. **DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)**: Invest a fixed amount regularly (monthly or quarterly) to reduce timing risk and smooth costs over time. Use only surplus funds.
2. **Value Investing**: Buy when price is below intrinsic value. Use metrics like P/E and P/B compared to industry averages or 5-year historical norms (e.g., buy when 10% below average).
3. **Buying the Dip**: Gradually buy when markets or specific stocks drop significantly (e.g., small buy at -10%, more at -20%). This assumes your fundamental analysis of the stock remains solid.

**Sell Strategies**

1. **Take Profit**: Sell when a target gain is reached. Set tiered sell points (e.g., sell 25% at +20% gain, another 25% at +40%). Don't let upward momentum deceive you into holding too long.
2. **Stop Loss**: Set a max acceptable loss percentage, usually around -10%. Many fail here due to a "sunk cost" fallacy or hope of a quick recovery.
3. **Fundamental Changes**: Sell when the company's fundamentals worsen—consecutive earnings misses, management changes, deteriorating competition, or policy risks.
4. **Rebalancing**: Adjust your portfolio back to target allocations (e.g., every 6 months). If a stock now exceeds its target weight by 5%, consider trimming it.
5. **Overvaluation**: Sell when valuation clearly exceeds reasonable levels (e.g., P/E is 50% above industry or historical average).

**Key Points**

1. **Set Alerts**: Use software alerts for target buy/sell prices instead of constant manual tracking.
2. **Emotional Control**: Avoid fear or greed driving irrational decisions. Stick to your preset strategy.
3. **Periodic Review**: Review your strategy and holdings every quarter to ensure they align with your goals.
4. **Iterative Execution**: Buy and sell in batches to mitigate timing risk.

**Finally, there is no perfect timing. The key is a systematic approach and discipline—something I learned after being burned by emotions.** invest wisely.
