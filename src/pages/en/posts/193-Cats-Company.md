<small>The cover photo was taken on Sunday evening while I was organizing the Trending Weekly. Tangyuan was resting quietly in a corner of the desk, purring occasionally. He loves being in the same space as me, and this quiet companionship feels wonderful.</small>

## Trending Tools

**SponsorBlock: Skip sponsor ads in YouTube videos**  
<https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sponsorblock-for-youtube/mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone>  
A "magical" Chrome extension that skips sponsored segments, subscription reminders, and other fillers in YouTube videos. it's community-driven, with segments marked by users.

**BilibiliSponsorBlock: Skip filler segments on Bilibili**

A port of SponsorBlock for Bilibili, automatically skipping sponsored segments and subscription reminders. I hold a neutral stance on this as many creators rely on these for income.

**kotaemon: Open-source, clean, and customizable RAG tool**  
<https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon>  
An open-source RAG tool for document-based AI chatting. The experience is good for both developers and end-users. clone it and give it a try.

**All-in-One Hacking Tools**  
<https://github.com/Z4nzu/hackingtool>  
Saw this All-in-One hacking toolkit on GitHub, including tools for anonymity, information gathering, SQL injection, reverse engineering, and more. Interesting for those into cybersecurity.

**Artificial Analysis: Model capability, price, and speed comparison**  
<https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/gpt-4o-mini>  
This comparison tool is very mature and useful for choosing the right LLM for your scenario or studying the differences between various models. Highly playable.

## Just Looking Around

**Five-year Reflection by Li Mu**  
<https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/374777591>  
A great article by Li Mu reflecting on his career stage—very applicable for today's workers as well.

**Black Myth: Wukong - Yaoguai Encyclopedia**  
<https://meethigher.top/blog/2024/black-wukong-youji/>  
A detailed collection: 203 yaoguai (monsters), 203 poems, and 203 stories. The images are especially good—it'd be interesting to use AI to generate modern versions based on these drawings.

**Li Mu's Method for Continuous Self-Improvement**  
Reviewed the recommended video from last issue. Li Mu's method for self-improvement is great—I've also been in the habit of periodic reflection to keep my goals clear and avoid drifting aimlessly.

**The lemon Perrier is delicious when iced**  
I used to find room-temperature Perrier terrible and wouldn't drink it without coconut water. But having a lemon-flavored iced one on the go was a revelation—like a subtle, zero-sugar Sprite. Recommended!
