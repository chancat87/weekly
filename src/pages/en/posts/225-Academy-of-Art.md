<small>The cover photo was taken over the weekend at the China Academy of Art, Xiangshan Campus, while viewing graduation works. I really liked the ones from the School of Sculpture; there was a centaur looking at a phone at the entrance, hahaha, it cracked me up.</small>

## Trending Tools

**GKD: Automatically remove open-screen ads on Android**  
<https://gkd.li/>  
If you use an Android phone, you should try GKD, a tool that automatically removes various apps' open-screen ads and performs automated operations. Formally defined as "an Android application for custom screen clicks based on accessibility, advanced selectors, and subscription rules," I consider it an upgraded version of "Li Tiao Tiao." It's open-source, continuously updated, supports subscription rules, and is very powerful and easy to use.

**AYA: A desktop app with built-in ADB and a GUI**  
<https://aya.liriliri.io/zh/>  
Recently started using an Android phone and found AYA, a desktop application with built-in ADB and a user interface built on its functionality. Compared to original ADB command-line input, it's easy to install, full-featured, has a graphical interface, and is very simple to use.

**PayQrcode: An interesting payment QR code solution**  
<https://pay-qrcode.4ce.cn/>  
This PayQrcode solution is quite interesting. Currently, many offline stores have two separate codes for WeChat and Alipay, which is inconvenient. This solution uses physical image merging technology to fuse WeChat and Alipay collection codes into a single image, achieving dual-code compatibility and recognition in offline scenarios. I tested it locally, and the recognition is excellent.

**BAGEL: An open-source unified multimodal model**  
<https://bagel-ai.org/>  
An open-source unified multimodal model, BAGEL, features AI capabilities like image-based chat, editing, rewriting, text-to-image, style transfer, and image reorientation. It's said to have capabilities comparable to GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0.

**Quarkdown: A great typesetting solution**  
<https://github.com/iamgio/quarkdown>  
I really love the Markdown standard for formatted writing—flexible yet standardized. The Quarkdown typesetting solution is built on MD; if you're preparing manuscripts for printed books or papers, give this tool a try. It adds useful extension capabilities and might suit engineers better than Word.

**Lucide: A beautiful and consistent icon library**  
<https://lucide.dev/>  
Lucide is a fantastic icon library with a simple, consistent style. When you need unified icons and theme colors without the hassle of choosing individual icons, try this—it's sufficient for normal app or website scenarios.

**Ratatui: A Rust library for building terminal user interfaces**  
<https://ratatui.rs>  
If your command-line tool is written in Rust, try Ratatui, an out-of-the-box TUI tool. However, if I were to write one, I'd probably use Node to call Rust capabilities; I feel that would be simpler.

## Just Looking Around

**Switched back to Spotify; it's just more comfortable**  
Switched back to Spotify. One great thing is its song recommendations—much smarter than Apple Music after two years of "training." Plus, it has many songs that are otherwise banned. Which music player do you use?

**Interesting works from the China Academy of Art**  
The graduation works at CAA are excellent. Friends in Hangzhou can make an appointment via their public account to see the exhibition; I went to the Xiangshan campus.
