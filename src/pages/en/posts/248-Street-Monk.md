<small>The cover image shows a street monk on a road in Tokyo, standing quietly and upright, chanting. This phenomenon is rarely seen in China, so I took a quick photo.</small>

## Trending Tools

**Pake: One-click Web-to-Desktop App Packager Releases New Version**
<https://github.com/tw93/Pake>
Recently released V3.5, mainly optimizing and refining the following supports:
0. Added `--force-internal-navigation` parameter, allowing all page jumps to open within Pake.

1. Fixed the internal file download experience to prevent repeated downloads, and fixed PNG conversion anomalies for icons in Linux environments.
2. Build scripts and dependency configurations updated to improve content output and resource stability, preventing logs from being invisible in some places.
In Pake's official packaged applications, this time I recommend a useful music tool for programmers to listen to while coding: ProgramMusic. The interface is very "Hacker," and the music itself leans towards instrumental. It's quite good and demonstrates the effect of Pake packaging a webpage into a desktop app.

**My blog was recently optimized**
<https://tw93.fun>
My blog is almost 10 years old. It was my first front-end project, and it has maintained this look since I designed and developed it, with no major changes. The Jekyll framework from 10 years ago still runs normally. Haha, unlike Node. I've added some minor features lately: this time, I added search capability and translated what could be Anglicized. Interested friends can take a look.

**Quick Tip: How to make your command line support Fingerprints**
<https://github.com/tw93/Mole>
On Mac, many times when we use command-line tools to perform system actions, we need to manually enter the startup password. I've always wondered if there's a way to use fingerprints. Later, Mole supported this feature. After a one-click setup with `mo touchid`, whenever the command line needs system permissions, you just need to press your finger on the sensor. It's very convenient and is a non-core feature of Mole.

**Display of 100 already extinct species**
<https://100lostspecies.com>
This website is very well-done. It takes you on an exploratory journey through 100 extinct species using interactive visualization. It's very aesthetic but also makes one feel sorry for the species that are no longer with us. Next time I'm looking for a product name, I can find one I like there.

**This AI World Clock is interesting**
<https://clocks.brianmoore.com>
This AI World Clock is interesting. It's an analog clock with pure front-end code generated by various large models, regenerated every minute and limited to 2000 tokens. See how many are just making things up; it's quite fun. Many "serious" systems are just making things up; serious coding is very important.

## Just Looking Around

**The open-source Chinese translation of "Agentic Design Patterns" is good**
<https://github.com/ginobefun/agentic-design-patterns-cn>
The open-source Chinese translation of "Agentic Design Patterns" is good. It's a practical guide for building intelligent systems, a bilingual translation of "Agentic Design Patterns: A Hands-On Guide to Building Intelligent Systems" by Antonio Gulli. A comprehensive technical guide covering core concepts and practical methods of Agent design in modern AI systems—worth a look.

**How to migrate your playlist to another platform?**
<https://tunemymusic.com/zh-CN/transfer>
Today I needed to transfer a playlist from NetEase Cloud Music to Apple Music. I looked up solutions, and it was quite good—it imported the vast majority of songs. First, go to <https://music.unmeta.cn> to convert the playlist URL into text format. Then go to <https://tunemymusic.com/zh-CN/transfer>, choose the "any text" mode, copy the playlist text to convert it into a playlist format list, click convert and choose Apple Music. After logging in, click convert, and you'll see songs going to your Music one by one. It's very useful; then just change the names if needed.

**Notes for this week**
Investment strategy still suitable for current AI-related US stocks:
Buy a few good companies that can make money stably in the long term with reliable management at a reasonable or even cheap price, and then hold them for the long term with extreme patience.
