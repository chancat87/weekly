<small>The cover photo shows the Tokyo Skytree I took earlier. At 634m, it's the tallest tower in the world. it looked beautiful against the clear sky—almost like a scene from an anime.</small>

## Pro-tip: How to achieve daily coffee freedom for under 1,000 RMB

<img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/fm/IMG_7802.jpg" width="800" />

Lately, one of my most meaningful purchases has been my coffee setup. here's how I did it:

Every morning, I grind beans, extract espresso with my semi-auto machine, and froth a half-cup of milk. The ritual is incredibly satisfying, and it’s much cheaper than Starbucks.

**The Machine:** I chose the **De'Longhi ECP33.21.W** from Sam's Club for 629 RMB. it's white, metallic, and has exactly two functions: extraction and frothing. it's perfect for beginners—durable and easy to clean.

**The Beans:** MM Classic Italian Roast (1kg for 99 RMB). The aroma is incredible, and the beans are oily and full-bodied. it’s not too acidic or bitter.

**The Milk:** Whole milk makes the best froth. I’ve tried several, and **Yoplait 4.0** or **Meiji** are both fantastic.

**The Accessories:** Don't skip an electric grinder—manual grinding for espresso is exhausting! A metal pitcher and a small cleanup kit (brush/cloth) make the process much more professional.

I thought I wouldn't use it much, but now it’s my morning motivation. it’s a great feeling to offer a guest a home-brewed cup!
