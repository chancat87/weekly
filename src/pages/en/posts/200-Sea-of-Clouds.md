<small>The cover photo shows a sunset over a sea of clouds I captured from a plane quite some time ago. One major purpose of this weekly is to encourage me to experience more of the diverse life out there. I've somehow reached 200 issues—I hope you're having a great time too.</small>

## Technical Learning

<https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/airbnbs-ai-powered-photo-tour-using-vision-transformer-e470535f76d4>  
Airbnb uses Vision Transformer to power its AI photo tours, helping hosts organize listing photos more effectively. I think this approach has many potential business applications.

**Big Front-end: Breaking the ceiling of dynamic containers?**  
<https://tech.meituan.com/2024/10/18/recce-in-meituan.html>  
An article from Meituan Tech. Mobile front-end developers often face the topic of cross-platform performance. I often agree that it's better for client containers to be continuously optimized based on specific business needs—like how some companies have perfected React Native over the years—rather than constantly introducing new cross-platform technologies and making things complex.

**NVIDIA wants 50,000 employees and 100 million AI assistants**  
<https://www.ifanr.com/1604046>  
ifanr's 20,000-word transcript of Jensen Huang's latest interview. I'm also very much looking forward to the arrival of AGI.

## Just Looking Around

**Principal Mei on living authentically in "Forever Young"**

Facing the stubborn Wu Linglan, Principal Mei Yiqi asked why he was studying. Wu said that as long as he was studying and giving himself to books, he felt at ease. Principal Mei asked, "What is authenticity?" Wu was puzzled.

Principal Mei said: "People immerse themselves in busyness and gain a numb sense of security, but lose authenticity. Your youth only has so many days." Wu then asked what authenticity was.

Principal Mei explained: "It's the peaceful joy that overflows from the depths of your heart—free of regret or shame—no matter what you see, hear, do, or who you are with."
