<small>The cover photo was taken over the weekend while viewing plum blossoms at Chaoshan in Hangzhou. It's about 40km from me. There were a lot of people, but the plum blossoms were beautiful.</small>

## Trending Tools

**Cursor Pro is exceptionally useful**  
<https://www.cursor.com/cn>  
$20 well spent on Cursor. The "Agent mode" for fixing bugs, running, and debugging makes it feel like having a brilliant engineer friend to talk to. It makes me even more bullish on AI software stocks!

**HiPixel: AI image upscaler based on Upscayl**  
<https://github.com/okooo5km/HiPixel>  
HiPixel is a native open-source macOS app based on Upscayl's AI upscaling. It’s much lighter than others I've seen—great for making low-res images high-definition.

## Technical Articles

**Exploration and Application of Prediction Technology in Meituan Elastic Scaling**  
<https://tech.meituan.com/2025/02/14/prediction-technology-in-meituan-elastic-scaling.html>  
This article is worth a read. It's great to see Meituan Tech collaborating with academia on technical research.

## Just Looking Around

**Why does the Apple Store adjust MacBook display angles to 76 degrees?**  
<https://www.uisdc.com/hunter/0221606148.html>  
Your first thought might be display optimization, but the truth is surprising! 76 degrees is actually *not* optimal for viewing, which encourages customers to step up and adjust the angle themselves. This physical touch creates "psychological ownership," increasing the desire to buy.

**IRIS shows beginners how to choose a camera**  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QvisCATm6I>  
This video is excellent. IRIS is so down-to-earth and funny, explaining camera selection and basic knowledge in a way that's easy for beginners to understand. Highly recommended.

**Portrait photographer "Mo Meng Xing x"**  
<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rRKce2EFQ>  
Found this photographer on Bilibili who made a video of portraits he took of his girlfriend over a year. It's very sweet and the effects are beautiful. After watching, you'll know what the three elements of portraiture are. Haha, now I want a camera—maybe an A7C2.
