<small>The cover photo is of some fried rice I had recently. I’ve realized that fried rice is a great way to measure a restaurant’s skill and passion: are the grains distinct? are the eggs and onions balanced? does it come out with that authentic "wok hei"? When done right, it’s a true delicacy.</small>

## Random Thoughts: On the "Front-end Entertainment Circle"

I personally dislike the "entertainment circle" vibe that has cropped up in the front-end community recently, with people treating technical roles like astrology or celebrity gossip.

I believe our community should focus more on technical exchange, sharing, and constructive debate rather than chasing heat or starting drama. Front-end development is uniquely interesting—a mix of problem-solving, engineering, and aesthetics. it’s the "Hacker and Painter" ideal. I switched from back-end to front-end in university after reading that book because I loved the instant gratification of creating beautiful effects with CSS, Canvas, and WebGL.

Ten years ago, the technical atmosphere in China was great, with many seniors sharing their implementations on platforms like CNode. it’s those selfless contributors who drew many students into the field. I hope we can return to that spirit of sharing and open-source contribution.

I’ll end with a quote from the late Chen Hao: "Spend your time on ideas—it's meaningful for you and society. gossiping about others won’t help you grow or improve your life. Your influence isn’t your ability to talk about others, but how many people trust you and seek your help."
