## Trending Tools

**Mole's features are finally gradually perfecting**
<https://github.com/tw93/Mole>
This time released the tenth version, continuing safety hardening, and adding a new "system status" view. Combined with the previous cleanup, uninstall, disk insight, and system optimization, it basically covers most of the functions for Mac maintenance. It's approximately equal to the combined power of CleanMyMac + AppCleaner + DaisyDisk + Sensei + iStat. Introducing the 5 major functions of Mole:

- `mo clean`: used to dig out various garbage, caches, and orphaned files in your Mac like a mole. The first use can clear out a lot of useless space.
- `mo uninstall`: very thoroughly uninstalls your software. Besides the app itself, it can also clear out various registry items, startup items, configuration files, etc.
- `mo optimize`: helps me optimize the system with one click, such as various refreshes, error resets, cache resets, service resets, and checking startup items.
- `mo analyze`: visualizes your disk space, allowing you to see some useless files that can be cleared. This is a good supplement to `clean`.
- `mo status`: provides a clear view of your computer's health, including disk read/write, battery usage, network status, process occupancy, and even whether the proxy is running normally.

**Support multi-speaker output on your Mac**
If you have a speaker next to your Mac, be sure to try opening "Audio MIDI Setup" and creating a "Multi-Output Device." Check both your Mac's speakers and external speakers. This will give you a much better audio experience, preventing you from using only one device at a time. This trick can also be used if you need to connect two pairs of AirPods when watching a drama.

**You can now use VSCode to develop and debug Mac apps**
It's been a long time since I used Xcode to develop Mac software because I found that VSCode can develop and debug Swift apps. You need to install the "LLDB DAP" and "Swift" extensions, then configure debugging in `vscode/launch.json` and automatic build in `.vscode/tasks.json`. Finally, you can happily develop, preview, and debug with `fn+F5`.
A lazy way is to let AICoding help you write these two configurations after you install the plugin. Of course, you can also ask ChatGPT if you don't understand.

**Quiver Quantitative: Track investment transactions of US Congress members**
<https://www.quiverquant.com/>
This Quiver Quantitative investment tool is very interesting. It tracks the investment transactions of US Congress members, as they are required to disclose their transactions within 45 days. It helps us gain investment directions beyond traditional financial reports, and I feel this is much better than recommendations from other ordinary investors.

**OpenRouter's LLM Rankings**
<https://openrouter.ai/rankings>
OpenRouter's LLM Rankings can to some extent show the current usage of large models by individuals or small companies. You can dig out some interesting data, and it also provides some data reference for AI US stock investors.

**Polymarket: A prediction market betting website**
<https://polymarket.com/>
Polymarket is quite interesting—a prediction market betting website where users can buy and sell bets on future real-world events such as political elections, sports matches, and economic indicators. Market prices reflect the crowd's estimate of the probability of these events occurring.
Its information aggregation ability is very strong, and the interaction method is quite interesting, combined with Web3. However, I feel that the gambling-like approach might not be allowed in many countries. But I think this business model is quite good, and I use it as a tool to analyze people's attitudes toward current hot spots.

## Just Looking Around

**This YouTube video is the most shocking one I've seen this year**
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjZvFY6__qw>
A very real feeling of man and nature merging together. The video is exquisite; I recommend playing it in the highest definition on a monitor. Ski mountaineer Andrzej Bargiel became the first person to climb Everest without oxygen and ski back to base camp—his first oxygen-free ascent, first ski descent. Truly the limit of humanity.

**Open source is coolest when you clear out the issues**
<https://github.com/tw93>
Recorded last week: the coolest time in open source is when all issues of a project I've been maintaining recently are resolved. That feeling is really a sigh of relief, very cool. These projects have been maintained for almost 5 years at the longest, with a combined total of nearly 55K Stars. Looking forward to the day when the Bug list looks empty, haha. Of course, welcome to follow me.

**Notes for this week**

1. The meaning of investment is to make life more stable and comfortable, rather than overdrawing your ability to pay and making you sleep poorly in exchange for a tiny bit of profit.
2. For the new generation of engineers, software used to be the weapon; now it's just a tool. Taste will be the new weapon.
