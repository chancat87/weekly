<small>The cover photo shows a Starlight MacBook Air 13.6-inch I bought over the weekend with national subsidies. Its feel, color, and weight are perfect—much better for home use than that Pro 16-inch that weighs several pounds. I'll share my "must-install" software in this issue.</small>

## Initialization Settings

1. Remove unused apps from the Dock to keep it clean, set it to auto-hide, and use configurations to make it open faster. Place it at the bottom.
2. Change the desktop background to solid black. I dislike the Mac notch, so "out of sight, out of mind" is my approach.
3. Set the trackpad to "Tap to Click." It feels much better than pressing down.
4. Set up many custom shortcuts. Most operations are triggered via shortcuts to form muscle memory.

## Essential Software

**Install Stash first for network connectivity**  
<https://stash.wiki/>  
The first priority is a smooth network. After years of experimenting, I use Stash on my phone, computer, and Apple TV. It syncs easily, looks good, and is reasonably priced. it's my go-to "set and forget" tool.

**WeChat Input Method for typing**  
<https://z.weixin.qq.com/>  
I used the native input method for about a year with mixed results. Six months ago, I switched to WeChat Input. It syncs perfectly between iPhone and Mac and is much cleaner than Sogou. Highly recommended if you want a change.

**Browser: Staying with Arc**  
<https://arc.net/>  
I used Edge for its vertical tabs last year, but after sticking with Arc for a while, it became second nature despite the initial complexity. I love hiding the sidebar with a shortcut—very elegant interaction once you master it.

**Raycast: One-click summon and many shortcuts**  
<https://www.raycast.com/>

**Shottr: Feature-rich screenshot tool**

**Ice: Hide your menu bar icons**

**Input Source Pro: Automatic input method switching**  
<https://inputsource.pro/zh-CN>

**uPic: Native image upload tool**  
<https://github.com/gee1k/uPic>  
For developers, uploading images to a CDN is a frequent task. I use this with a custom FaaS function—exceptionally useful.

**Follow: A great RSS reader**  
<https://follow.is/>  
As someone who doesn't use TikTok or news apps, I rely on RSS for information. Follow frequently surprises with its updates and has become my default reader.

**Command X: Bringing back "Cut" for files**  
<https://apps.apple.com/us/app/command-x/id6448461551?mt=12>  
I cannot accept Mac's complex file cutting shortcut—this app brings back Command + X.

### Paid Tools

**Bob: Exceptional translation and OCR tool**
