## Random Thoughts

**How Engineers Can Invest Better**  
<https://tw93.fun/2025-07-17/money.html>  
This was a simple sharing session within my team last week. I took some time over the weekend to organize it. It discusses how engineers can invest better. Since buying US stocks is high-risk, I don't suggest everyone follow it; you need your own judgment. Just treat it as my random talk and read it for fun. The content is quite long, so let's treat it as the main content of this Weekly.

**MiaoYan recently updated to 1.16, named "Small delight" 🎉**  
<https://github.com/tw93/MiaoYan>  
Haha, "missing person" returns! My native Mac lightweight Markdown notebook, MiaoYan, recently updated to 1.16, named "Small delight." It added a very beautiful font—you can update to "TsangerJinKai" in the settings. Additionally, it supports block rendering for LaTeX formulas, fixes duplicate case-sensitive title prompts, and resolves issues where emails weren't highlighted or clickable. Interested friends can give it a try.

## Trending Tools

**Found a global temperature map tool**

The weather has been very hot lately. I found a global temperature map that's quite comprehensive. You can use it to see where the world's "furnaces" are.

**Rewind Music App is very concise**  
<https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rewind-music-time-travel/id6444778869>  
This music app is very minimalist, called "Rewind: Music Time Travel"—a time machine for traversing the music world. Available on Android and iPhone, it lets you choose music from past eras or this week in history. The design is comfortable, and it's free. Give it a spin.

**Concise "Colorful QRCode" extension**  
<https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colorful-qrcode/nenelpicledkmgnlaibhjkjobffpjoan?pli=1>  
When developing, I often need to scan the current webpage's info into an App to see the effect. Many QR code extensions are a bit too flashy and complex. You can try Colorful QRCode; it can be set to black and white, resulting in this extremely minimalist QR code.

## Just Looking Around

**Bought some wired earbuds to play with**  
Direct Type-C port, stainless steel material—the upgraded version of Fengling. Balanced armature and ceramic piezoelectric diaphragm dual-cavity MMCX earbuds. The texture is great, and the sound quality is pretty decent. Continued listening.
