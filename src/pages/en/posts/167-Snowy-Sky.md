## Technical Learning

**Trending Weekly now supports Dark Mode! 🎉**  
<https://weekly.tw93.fun/>  
I added dark mode support over the weekend for night readers. it follows the system theme automatically. The coolest part? I implemented it using just a few lines of CSS filter tricks. 🧐 Do you prefer light or dark mode for reading articles?

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  html {
    filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);
  }
  html img,
  html video {
    filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);
  }
}
```

**Life Tip: check Xianyu before buying movie tickets**  
You can often find tickets at 30-40% off by searching for the theater on Xianyu. I got two Dune IMAX tickets for 105 RMB instead of the original 150 RMB. it's the exact same QR code process. 😂
