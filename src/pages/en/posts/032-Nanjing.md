<small>The cover was taken at the Presidential Palace in Nanjing. For city travel, I highly recommend finding a small local group tour for the last day—they cover all the major landmarks, handle the transport, and drop you right at the station. Nanjing is a very "trendy" city; highly recommend trying the local food and exploring Xinjiekou.</small>

        let time = useState(Date())

        useEffect(.once) {
            let timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 1, repeats: true) {
                time.wrappedValue = $0.fireDate
            }
            return { timer.invalidate() }
