<small>The cover photo was taken last week during a walk in the office park after dinner. The combination of green trees, glass, light, clouds, and fitness is beautiful. I especially love this shade of blue; it makes me feel happy.</small>

## Trending Tools

**Tailspin: A CLI tool for log file highlighting**  
<https://github.com/bensadeh/tailspin/>  
Found a CLI tool called Tailspin that highlights log files. After installation, just replace your usual log viewing command with `tspin` to see highlighted logs, making them much easier to read and debug.

**Life Tip: Carrier-level spam call blocking**  
China's major carriers (Unicom, Mobile, Telecom) all have free system-level harassment call blocking. it's simpler than installing an app—you can enable it directly via their WeChat accounts. I've found Unicom's to be good, though some report that China Mobile's can be over-aggressive, so use with discretion.

## Technical Learning

**easy_rust: Learning Rust explained in easy English**  
<https://github.com/Dhghomon/easy_rust>  
Found a great tutorial on GitHub: "Rust explained using easy English." it's perfect for non-native English speaking programmers. You can learn Rust basics while brushing up on your English—killing two birds with one stone.

## Random Notes

**Book Recommendation: "The Worlds I See" by Fei-Fei Li**  
<https://book.douban.com/subject/36672955/>  
I've been reading Fei-Fei Li's memoir "The Worlds I See" lately. I've been waiting for the simplified Chinese edition, and it's finally here. it's so well-written—it feels like hearing a neighbor or friend tell their story of growing into a top scientist. it also provides a great look at the history of AI. A rare, literary scientific memoir.
