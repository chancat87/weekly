**Elon Musk's Five-Step Work Method**

1. **Question every requirement.** Every requirement should be attached to a person’s name. Never accept a requirement from "legal" or "safety"—you must know the individual responsible. Question it, no matter how smart they are.Requirements from smart people are the most dangerous because they are less likely to be questioned. Even if it comes from Musk himself, question and improve it.
2. **Delete as much as you can.** You can always add it back later. if you don't end up adding back at least 10% of what you deleted, you haven't deleted enough.
3. **Simplify and optimize.** This MUST come after step 2. People often make the mistake of optimizing a process that shouldn't even exist.
4. **Accelerate cycle time.** Every process can be faster, but only after following the first three steps. at Tesla, I once spent too much energy speeding up a process that should have been removed entirely.
5. **Automate.** A big mistake at the Nevada and Fremont factories was trying to automate every step from the start. We should have questioned requirements, deleted unnecessary parts, and fixed issues before automating.

**Additional Principles:**

1. All technical managers must have hands-on experience (e.g., software managers must spend 20% of their time coding).
2. "Being nice" is dangerous—it stops people from questioning their peers' work.
3. Making mistakes is okay; refusing to admit them is not.
4. Never ask your team to do something you wouldn't do yourself.
5. Cross levels to solve problems. talk directly to your underlings' underlings if needed.
6. Hire for attitude; skills can be taught.
7. The only real rules are physics; everything else is a recommendation.
