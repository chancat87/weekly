## Just Looking Around

**Random Talk: AI's impact on different types of programmers**

- Boosts programmers with great ideas but average technical skills.
- Widens the boundaries for those with both great ideas and high skills.
- Neutralizes the uniqueness of those with high skills but no original ideas.
- Increases anxiety for those with neither ideas nor technical depth.

**Curious Research: Do you have pirated software on your computer?**  
I polled the community about pirated software use among domestic programmers. Out of 1381 votes, 1/3 have none, while 2/3 have some. I'm not proud to say I used some early in my career, but I've since switched to open-source or paid alternatives. I encourage others to do the same!
