<small>The cover image shows a station photo taken while riding the Maglev from the airport in Changsha. The two characters for "Changsha" are very evocative. As soon as I returned to Changsha, I could smell the scent of betel nut.</small>

**🎉 Mole: Dig deep like a mole to clean your Mac**
<https://github.com/tw93/Mole>
Mole has updated again! The cleanup section adds more safe operations and multi-threaded acceleration. This time, I’m introducing another feature of 🐹: the very thorough software uninstallation function. Besides uninstalling the App itself, it deeply searches for nearly dozens of possible deletions of App files/caches/settings. It's even cleaner than the App Cleaner & Uninstaller I purchased before. On the small command line, a friend helped add search and sorting, which is very useful. Give it a try.

**"Shitcode" Detector is quite interesting**
<https://github.com/Done-0/fuck-u-code>
This command-line tool is quite interesting. The name is a bit crude, called "Shit Mountain Code Detector." it evaluates the "shit-mountain level" of code and outputs a beautiful report. I tried it on my own project, and it was "refreshing, as if the code had been kissed by an angel." Not bad at all.

## Just Looking Around

**Discussion on Hacker News about the next stage for engineers**
<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378321>
The discussion on Hacker News is very similar to a view I had before. In the current development, engineers should actually progress to the next stage. Previously, many programmers could thrive on LeetCode, frameworks, and titles. Now, it's more about engineers who can solve problems; those who can help the company make money and with delivery will last longer.

**Just Saying**
Rewatching Ready Player One, the phrase at the very end is especially important in today's AI-filled world: we all need to spend more time in reality, because reality is the only thing that's real. Text without thought isn't, images that look like real people aren't, and fake videos that look like reality aren't either.
