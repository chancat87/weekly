## Technical Learning

**Where did the word "bug" come from?**  
A very clever explanation: it dates back to 1945, when a moth got trapped in a computer's circuitry, causing it to fail. Grace Hopper taped the dead moth into her logbook, noting, "This is the bug that stopped us today." hence, "bug" became the technical term for flaws or issues in a system.

## Pro-tip: Recommended Apps for Apple TV

I've been using Apple TV for about 6 months, and these are the apps I find most useful:

1. **Netflix**: Fantastic quality, well-produced content. I use a Singapore node for Chinese-related content.
2. **YouTube**: My go-to for high-res videos—digital news, concerts, and Taiwanese variety shows.
3. **Spotify**: My default player on all devices, so it's natural to use it on TV too. Great for podcasts.
4. **VidHub**: Combined with Alibaba Cloud Drive, it's faster and better than Infuse for localized content (like K-Dramas).
5. **Cheers**: A solid Bilibili third-party app with Danmaku support.
6. **APTV**: For live TV, mainly for when older family members visit.
7. **Stash**: My choice for network proxy and multi-device sync.

Screen sharing from iPhone to Apple TV is also very smooth—great for using apps like Keep for workouts. For subscriptions, joining shared family plans is very cost-effective.
