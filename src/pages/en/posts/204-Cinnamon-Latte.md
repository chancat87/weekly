## Just Looking Around

**Ryuichi Sakamoto's playlist for a Japanese restaurant**  
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyF_H5mySFA3TqDp9uQZ0TJrjjJ_b38Ty>  
Ryuichi Sakamoto loved dining at a particular Japanese restaurant. The food was great but the music was terrible, so he created a custom playlist for them for free called "The Kajitsu Playlist." Interestingly, it doesn't include any of his own music. Very suitable for quiet settings. Also on [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/cn/playlist/the-kajitsu-playlist/pl.u-JPAZbl2tDMMkMPN), [NetEase Music](https://music.163.com/#/playlist?app_version=9.1.66&id=7063054826&dlt=0846&creatorId=411619512), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2YY3rAwm9tldNhlBmuMqgY), and [QQ Music](https://y.qq.com/n/ryqq/playlist/4225835832).

**Try the Tesla Christmas Easter Egg**  
Open the Toybox, find "Santa" in the bottom bar, and tap "Santa mode." It turns cars on the road into reindeer and people into Santas. it even rings bells when turning. Very cute.
