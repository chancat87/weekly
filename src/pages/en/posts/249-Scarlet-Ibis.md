**Quantitative Analysis of Bitcoin in Modern Portfolios**
I used my recent favorite, NotebookLM, to create a "Quantitative Analysis of Bitcoin in Modern Portfolios" for my considerations next year.

**Pake: One-click Web-to-Desktop App Packager Releases New Version**
<https://github.com/tw93/Pake>
Pake completed the 3.6 version update. With 43.8K Stars, all issues have been cleared. Named "Handsome" 🥷🏻, this time I recommend the officially packaged Gemini. Coupled with shortcuts, it makes up for the lack of a native client. Haha, I've been really partial to Google lately; their AI is finally in the first tier, which is great.

1. Menu Bar Enhancement: Added a brand new native menu system, including Navigation / View / Edit / Window / Help, and supplemented with richer shortcuts: Back/Forward/Home, Refresh, Zoom control, Copy current URL, Window on top, etc.
2. Multi-account/OAuth Login Support: Systematically solved the problem of third-party logins like Google and GitHub being unable to jump or showing a white screen in Pake. Optimized window open and authentication popup interception logic for a smoother login process.
3. Automatic Theme Adaptation: Mac Titlebar supports automatic color switching based on the webpage's dark/light mode. Both system switching and in-page switching can respond intelligently.
4. CLI Parameter Enhancement: Added capabilities like --zoom, --min-width, --min-height, and perfected the internal jump experience for --force-internal-navigation.
5. Windows Installation Optimization: Fixed the potential timeout issue when installing dependencies for the first time, adding intelligent retry and automatic CN mirror switching.

**Mole (Little Mole) Continues to Update**
<https://github.com/tw93/Mole>
In 2 months, it reached 8.5K Stars. Thanks for everyone's love and for bearing with the previous immature versions. This time V1.12 is released, adding a special December Christmas Easter egg—a little red hat. Mole celebrates Christmas too.

1. Cleanup Capability Upgrade: `mole clean` adds cleanup rules for various local models, Docker, and browser caches. The `--dry-run` mode supports exporting a detailed list for review, giving you a better understanding of what will be cleaned before execution. Added `--debug` for better troubleshooting.
2. `mole optimize` adds the `--whitelist` parameter, supporting skipping specific firewall or system update checks, optimizing only what you need.
3. `mole status` supports identifying the number of CPU/GPU cores and adds real-time monitoring of battery health, system load, and network throughput, as well as temperature acquisition.
4. Safety first: All file operations are integrated with safety APIs, and over 130 automation test cases have been added to ensure stability.

**librepods, a nice open-source tool**
<https://github.com/kavishdevar/librepods>
Freed AirPods from the shackles of the Apple ecosystem, allowing you to use almost all AirPods features on Android phones, such as noise cancellation control, adaptive mode, ear detection, hearing aid features, and battery status. It's very well-made.

**Lately playing with an open-source Voice Agent framework**
<https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework>
Lately playing with an open-source Voice Agent framework, TEN Framework. It's like an "Operating System for Real-time Voice / Multimodal Agents": within a unified real-time stream framework, it turns modules like STT, LLM, TTS, VAD, and Avatar into pluggable "building blocks" that can be combined and replaced as needed. The focus is on solving engineering problems related to low-latency, multimodal, and cross-terminal deployment for real-time AI conversations.
Spent 10 minutes deploying and running it locally. Even without replacing anything, the actual experience of its real-time voice FAQ is very smooth: interruptible, fast enough response, with a latency of about 1s. Common capabilities like Memory and RAG are already connected for you. Based on these, you can extend to scenarios like AI emotional companionship, AI oral practice, phone AI customer service, and smart voice hardware. I tested it with official examples, and the effect is quite good. Students interested in "true real-time" voice Agents can check out this open-source framework.

## Just Looking Around

**TIME’s Top 100 Photos of 2025**
<https://time.com/7336112/top-100-photos-2025/>
TIME’s Top 100 Photos of 2025. Weekly magazine's photo of the year selection. I like this one best; this is a sense of reality that AI-generated images probably can't compare to, and it's also a sense of reality that is much needed in this era.

**A very good drama: "Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty"**
<https://movie.douban.com/subject/35235151/>
There are currently 3 seasons. It's filmed very well, not using those familiar stars, the actors' skills are in place, and the detective logic in the drama is a clear suspense drama. A well-made drama. If you're looking for something to watch, I highly recommend it; it's good.

**Fried a very delicious and appetizing green pepper with century egg**
The method is very simple: first add a small amount of oil, after it's hot, add garlic cloves and green peppers, add salt, fry until half-cooked and set aside. Then continue adding oil, add the cut century eggs, stir-fry over high heat. When it's almost done, add the previously fried green peppers, add MSG, soy sauce, oyster sauce. If you like it spicy, you can add a bit more chili powder. Finally, add some spring onions before taking it out of the pan.
It's very delicious with rice. You can try it out.

**Highly recommend the ab roller for fitness**
Requires little space, available at any time. Practice kneeling first then standing.
In about 10 days, you can start to feel the muscle.

**This week, a few words on AI and humans**
In the stage where AI is being used extensively, I instead pay more attention to the "sense of a living person." I don't like AI gems that look almost the same as the real world, but I quite like the novel, innovative, and eye-opening masterpieces generated.

Recently on the Chinese social timeline, the "authentic and unique voices" from three years ago when I first started using Twitter are slowly disappearing. Back then, friends who hadn't met exchanged useful products, technologies, and specific views on things very kindly.

Now, maybe driven by words like "going overseas, making money, training," many sensational call-to-action tactics like "Brothers, this is awesome! You must see this! This is mind-blowing!" have appeared, followed by a very AI-generated image and a long passage of text. Recently, I feel another reason for account bans is seeing some groups liking and following each other, heating up popularity after posting, being recognized as robot-like behavior leading to bans. Instead, it has turned into a trend of traffic priority rather than exchange and content priority. But it's also understandable; making money comes first before content.

So you'll find that much content has become as if published by the same AI, lacking the unique flavor of the account itself, and appearing in batches. In fact, many times, I feel everyone's sense of uniqueness is their most important thing—a unique personality shaped by your life experiences, studies, and feelings from childhood to adulthood. No one's taste will be exactly like yours; this is your most important thing, and also the most interesting thing about living.

Of course, one might be asked: then should we stop using AICoding to write code? Actually, no. Writing code by hand can be considered a kind of enjoyment, like the difference between the process of cooking yourself and spending money to eat out. Although it takes time, it makes yourself happy. AICoding belongs to things you should have completed long ago but don't want to do anymore, letting AI help complete them. But in this process, your unique ideas and your overall coordination of the entire process are still in your hands, not entirely in AI's hands. Taste is still controlled by yourself. Open source will also slowly become about the product's effect and innovative ideas being more important than the code itself.

The same goes for AIGC content and generated images; what effect is wanted is still in human hands, rather than completely relying on AI without thinking. The biggest concern is authorizing everything to AI, working under the poor content generated by AI, or even helping promote it. That would be reverse.

Finally, I want to say, don't give up your sense of a living person in the AI era. You are the master of AI, not its appendage.
