## Trending Tools

**Grok is exceptionally good; give it a try**  
<https://grok.com/>  
Grok is amazing—DeepSearch is comfortable, fast, and smart. As a Tesla shareholder, I'm very pleased. Highly recommended for analyzing investment logic. If you need a desktop client, try the [Pake-packaged version](https://github.com/tw93/Pake).

**VisActor: Beautiful open-source visualization components**  
<https://visactor.io/>  
I've been looking for beautiful open-source visualization components and found VisActor by ByteDance. It feels fresher than other libraries I've seen, and the components are very comprehensive.

**NocoDB: Open-source Airtable alternative**  
<https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb>  
I've been following NocoDB for two years; they’ve released over 160 versions—quite impressive. Given the combination of spreadsheets and DeepSeek, I think this data organization method is superior to many other forms.

**Glance: Open-source self-hosted dashboard**  
<https://github.com/glanceapp/glance>  
Glance is an interesting open-source self-hosted dashboard. It’s visually appealing and lets you view all your info sources—RSS, Hacker News, weather, YouTube, stock prices, Docker status—in one place. Like an all-in-one data system.

**Beszel: Open-source lightweight server monitoring platform**  
<https://beszel.dev/zh/>  
Beszel is an open-source lightweight server monitoring tool with Docker stats, historical data, and alerts. The interface is friendly and comfortable—worth studying for its product interaction.

## Just Looking Around

**Checked out popular Fujifilm cameras in a store**  
Looked at the X100VI—so beautiful and perfect for street photography, but out of stock everywhere and impossible to buy even with a markup. It’s practically digital gold; buy it now and you could make a profit in 3 years. The XT5 is also beautiful but heavy; the XT50 is a good middle ground despite being less attractive.
