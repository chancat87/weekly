<small>The cover photo was taken over the weekend during a walk. I saw a boat in the distance in the river with cooking smoke. I walked over and took a photo; seeing someone cooking inside immediately made the boat feel alive.</small>

**Replace ugly icons on your Mac with one click**  
<https://github.com/Bengerthelorf/macIconChanger>  
macIconChanger is good for beginners; it lets you replace ugly icons on your Mac with clean icons from macOSicons. For simplified users, I suggest just downloading the icon and dragging it onto the app's icon in the "Get Info" window (Command + I).

**Found a great thing: Dryer Balls**  
Found dryer balls! I initially thought they were a gimmick, but they're surprisingly useful. They make clothes very fluffy after washing. Imagine a bunch of clothes rolling in the dryer—they tend to clump together. These balls act as buffers and strike the clothes, making drying much more even for quilts and even shortening drying time. Highly recommended! Sam's Club has 12 for only 29 RMB; using 5 at a time lasts a long time.
