## Trending Tools

**Mole (Little Mole) CLI, which can clean dozens of GBs on Mac at once, has updated again!**
<https://github.com/tw93/Mole>
Released V1.8, named "Growing up." The updates are as follows:

1. Added cleanup for more browsers: Dia, Comet, Orion, Zen, with smart handling of Service Worker caches.
2. Added Raycast one-click installation and Alfred workflow; you can directly call it by typing "clean."
3. Added an incremental verification mechanism for app uninstallation, making it safer and more efficient, for more complete and faster app removal.
4. Optimized cleanup loading with unified progress feedback and loading animations, so you won't be in a hurry. Also supported Nix package manager garbage collection.

**MiaoYan companion theme for NetNewsWire**
<https://github.com/tw93/MiaoYan-NetNewsWire-Theme>
I highly recommend NetNewsWire, the open-source Mac RSS client, for friends who like simplicity and light weight. If you subscribe to this Weekly or my blog, I recommend it even more because I wrote a theme for it that's identical to the Weekly's. This makes it look much simpler and clearer. Plus, being natively implemented, the performance is exceptionally good. You can download and install the theme here.

**AyuGram - a very well-made Telegram client for Mac/Android**
<https://github.com/AyuGram/AyuGramDesktop>
AyuGram is a very well-made Telegram Mac/Android client. It removes ads, gets rid of the top video, supports "ghost mode," and allows for extensive customization. It's much cleaner than the official one and very nice to use. Interested friends can check it out.

## Just Looking Around

**Futu’s investment practical information collection is very good**
<https://news.futunn.com/news-topics/127/investment-practical-information-collection>
This collection of investment practical information by Futu is very good, focusing on some value investing ideas that I like very much. Friends interested in investing can take a look.

**Seeing this while going out to eat—I want my shop to be like this in the future**
Hahaha, rewritten with some jokes—purely for fun, don't take it seriously.
The team has only two programmers.
All code is hand-written and debugged.
Cannot complete requirements quickly during peak periods; tasks are handled according to priority.
Rush requests are not accepted.
I am tired of arguing; please understand and thanks. Please choose your requests carefully.
The code might not be written that well; it's purely because I have no "manners"—and am afraid of trouble.
