<small>The cover photo was taken on the way to Xianyang Airport from Xi'an. I haven't seen such a large chimney in a long time; it's massive and quite impressive.</small>

## Trending Tools

**Foundations of LLMs: An open-source book worth reading**  
<https://github.com/ZJU-LLMs/Foundations-of-LLMs>  
This open-source book "Foundations of LLMs" from Zhejiang University is worth a look. The writing style is excellent—readable, rigorous, and deep. It's a solid textbook for learning about large models.

**TheBoringNotch: An open-source Mac notch utility**  
<https://theboring.name/>  
Found an open-source Mac notch tool. Instead of just a useless black block, it turns the notch into a functional area similar to the Dynamic Island. While I think the iPhone's Dynamic Island is also quite ugly, TheBoringNotch makes this area more refined, making things like music switching and schedule viewing very convenient. Looking forward to more features.

**Playing Tetris inside a PDF file?**  
<https://th0mas.nl/downloads/pdftris.pdf>  
Magic! Yes, you didn't see it wrong—playing Tetris inside a PDF file. You can study how it's implemented. This broke my original assumptions, much like how many interesting things can actually be done inside Excel.

**"You call this damn thing a network?" - An interesting Bilibili video**  
<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17x6hYZEzJ/>  
A simple video that explains computer network basics clearly. Compared to AI-native programming under current rapid AI development, it gives a sense of the fun of learning computer basics from university days. Well worth a watch.

**Self-consistent Programmer**  
<https://www.dev-life.site/>  
"Self-consistent Programmer," written by a Peking University Software graduate, is worth a read for programmers at different stages of their careers. It's very grounded and helpful for understanding industry emotions, how to stay self-consistent, how to find happiness in work, and how to shift your mindset.

**US Stock investment record for daughter's Lunar New Year money**  
Updating the "18-year fixed investment experiment" mentioned in the last issue: I've bought in. Considering ARKK's long-term stability and to avoid fractional shares, S&P and Nasdaq account for 85%, while ARKK takes 15% for now. As of this Sunday, ARKK has actually risen nearly 10 points. Interesting! Looking forward to the year-end results.
