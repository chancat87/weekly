**2025: The Year in LLMs**
<https://tw93.fun/2026-01-14/llm.html>
I spent a whole night translating Simon Willison’s Weblog post, "2025: The year in LLMs." I think it's exceptionally well-written and gives a clear picture of the entire large language model landscape over the past year. I hope this provides some valuable insights for those following AI and AI investments.

**Introducing the Last 3 Versions of Mole**
<https://github.com/tw93/Mole>
Mole 1.22 has been updated. I've compiled the last three versions, named Fortified🦉, and here are 5 interesting points to share with you all.
1. Safer Uninstalls: Directly removed the high-risk "empty folder cleanup," added path traversal protection and Bundle ID verification, tightened BOM receipt scanning, and made LaunchAgents detection more cautious. The core goal is to minimize the risk of accidental deletion and injection.
2. Smoother Terminal Experience: The `mo clean` spinner is more fluid and has a delayed stop to eliminate flickering. Key cleanup steps now have continuous feedback, upgrading the experience from "usable" to "comfortable."
3. Homebrew Uninstall Optimization: `brew uninstall` now provides real-time output, automatically follows up with `brew autoremove` with progress indicators, adds timeout protection to prevent hanging, and fixes sudo in non-interactive environments.
4. Status Page as a Monitoring Dashboard: Network traffic now has a sparkline visualization with scrolling history, and the terminal width is adaptive. Upgraded gopsutil for better Apple Silicon compatibility and lower memory usage, and added fixes for CPU temperature and battery power overflow.
5. Various Compatibility Fixes: Systematically addressed a series of edge-case issues, including Teams misidentification, pnpm store paths, special character password input, Dock cleanup caused by /Applications symbolic links, Firefox IndexedDB path misjudgment, and JetBrains family cache detection.

**Another Useful Log Viewing Tool**
<https://github.com/bensadeh/tailspin>
If you frequently view logs in the terminal, give tailspin a try. It uses a clever set of regular expressions to scan content line by line, automatically colorizing key information like timestamps, numbers, and severity levels without requiring the logs to follow a fixed format. It works out of the box with different project log files or piped streams with minimal configuration.

## Just Looking Around

**YouTube: Understand Finance and Investment in an Hour**
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEDIj9JBTC8>
This video is perfect for investment novices. It comes from William Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management. Although it's a share from 13 years ago, it's very valuable. He uses a lemonade stand business to explain finance and investment in a simple and understandable way, and many of his conclusions still hold true today.

First, understand the three financial statements: The balance sheet shows what you have, what you owe, and what's left over. The income statement shows whether you made money over a period, accounting for revenue, costs, interest, and depreciation. The cash flow statement is the most critical—it shows if money is actually coming in and if it's being continuously spent, determining whether you can expand or survive a downturn. Many people only look at profit, ignoring cash flow and debt structure. The problem often isn't about making money, but whether you can sustain.

The financing part is also straightforward: debt and equity are two types of commitments. Borrowing money means a fixed return, and the lender gets paid first if things go wrong, but the upside is capped. Issuing equity means taking on more risk; shareholders get paid only after debts are cleared, but the potential return is much higher if the business succeeds. An IPO is essentially selling equity to the public: the company gets funds to keep running, or early shareholders gain liquidity.

In investing, he repeatedly emphasizes two things: compound interest and drawdowns. Compounding takes time; the earlier you start, the better. A small difference in return rate can become a huge gap over decades. Drawdowns are the enemy of compounding. A 50% loss requires a 100% gain to break even, so in long-term investing, "avoiding big losses" isn't conservative, it's efficient.

What kind of company is suitable for long-term holding? His criteria are simple: can you explain how it makes money in a few sentences? Is the brand strong enough that users are willing to keep buying? Does it have a moat that others can't copy? Is the debt manageable? Is it not overly dependent on external variables like interest rates, exchange rates, or commodity prices? Is it capital-efficient—not a business that must constantly burn money to grow? This seems like a preference, but it's actually a way to filter out companies that are hard to predict in the future.

Psychology and discipline are like a baseline: dare to buy during a panic and dare to sell when it's overheated, but only if you've done your own research, not just because you recognize the name. Before entering the market, deal with high-interest debt and keep 6–12 months of emergency funds to avoid being forced to sell at the worst possible price.

If you don't have time to research individual stocks, no problem: use funds or index investing. Let the system do the research for you. When choosing a fund manager, focus on credibility, whether the strategy is explainable, if the long-term record is verifiable, and if your interests are aligned. (PS: I would recommend something like the S&P 500 here; it has that fund manager feel.)

Finally, he recommends "The Intelligent Investor," which is also worth a read.

**Try Manus, I Find It Very Useful**
<https://manus.im/invitation/OTUUQYRNLHLPI>
If you're also an investor, I highly recommend exporting your holdings and transaction records and sending them to Manus for analysis. My testing shows it performs better than Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini.
He's like an experienced investment manager operating his professional computer with your records, using various analytical queries to give you a satisfactory report, and pointing out where your past investments have gone wrong with great insight.

**The Best Snail Noodles in Hangzhou**
It has to be the Feizai Luo·Xihuan Feizai Luosifen near Wulin Yintai. You must try the stir-fried snail noodles; it was my first time, and it was delicious.
