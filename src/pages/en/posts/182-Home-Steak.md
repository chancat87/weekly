<small>The cover photo shows a steak I made over the weekend. Seasoned with black pepper, salt, and oil for 5 minutes, then seared for a minute on each side, followed by a low-heat finish with butter, garlic, cherry tomatoes, and rosemary. Absolutely delicious!</small>

**Streamline: A better tool for custom text expansion**  
<https://github.com/brianyu28/streamline>  
I was looking for a better text expansion tool for custom phrases. while Apple's built-in tool is okay, I wanted something faster and more customizable (e.g., `vdz` for my address, `vdh` for my phone number). `Streamline` is open-source and much more minimalist than the paid `aText`.
