<small>The cover photo shows two "Xiangshou" crabs I bought on Dingdong Maicai a month ago. They have incredible vitality and eat almost anything—vegetables, dried shrimp, even dry noodles. They've become a "real-world TV" for the two cats at home.</small>

## Trending Tools

**Highly recommending Cursor AI Code Editor**  
<https://www.cursor.com/>  
I tried Cursor AI about six months ago but didn't have a great experience. Recently, many friends told me it's much better now, so I gave it another go. it's truly impressive—the transition from VSCode is seamless, and it can arguably replace it entirely since it's essentially VSCode with deeply integrated, super-useful AI. Product-wise, this integrated experience is far superior to just using extensions.

**Collection of 3613 high-def company logos**  
<https://fey.com/marketing/logos>  
Found a collection of 3,613 high-def company logos on Fey's logo database. You can search and download them as SVGs. Perfect for investment, bookkeeping, asset tracking, or company research where you need consistent, high-quality logos.

**Try imFile for your download needs**  
<https://imfile.io/>  
If you frequently download files, try imFile. It supports torrents, magnet links, plays any video file, is cross-platform, and helps you find resources. it's a much better alternative to tools like Xunlei.

## Technical Learning

**Software Engineering at Google**  
<https://qiangmzsx.github.io/Software-Engineering-at-Google/#/>  
This bilingual version of "Software Engineering at Google" is worth a read. Software engineering is more than just programming—it's about team collaboration, processes, knowledge sharing, testing, and delivery.

**Former Google CEO's candid Stanford talk**  
<https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jSOu93QvX2_Xx7Av4COoHw>  
Eric Schmidt, who was Google CEO for 10 years, recently gave a talk at Stanford CS. He was extremely candid, even telling the students mid-way that the session was confidential and not to share his words... only for the organizers to point out there were cameras live-streaming the whole thing. His face just froze.

## Just Looking Around

**Douban Music Top 250**  
<https://music.douban.com/top250>  
Found a treasure trove. When you feel like there's no good new music, search for "Douban Music Top 250" on music apps or Google. it reminded me that Khalil Fong's "Orange Moon" from my high school days still sounds fantastic today.

**Quick Tip: Latte with Ceylon Cinnamon**  
When making a latte at home, try adding a small spoonful of Ceylon cinnamon powder. it gives it a unique and delicious flavor. You can also try cinnamon with apple cider vinegar, or even dipping apple slices in it.
