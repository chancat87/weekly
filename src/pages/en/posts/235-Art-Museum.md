<small>The cover image was taken over the weekend when I took my Fujifilm to photograph the Xiao Feng Art Museum. It features 503 representative works from the 80-year artistic career of Xiao Feng (former president of the China Academy of Art) and his wife Song Ren. I really love the architectural design and the pairing of the windows with the outside scenery; it's well worth a visit.</small>

Pake - easily build webpages into lightweight multi-platform desktop apps with Rust. Long time no see; many features have been updated. I personally love the default packages for WeChat Reading, Grok, Li Zhi Music, and YouTube Music—I use them often. This update includes:

1. Smart Icon Acquisition: Automatically fetch high-definition icons for websites when no icon is provided, offering better visual effects and user experience.
2. CLI greatly enhanced: Added parameters like `--proxy`, `--incognito`, `--title`, `--hide-on-close` (system tray), and `--inject` (multiple file injection).
3. Icon display fixes: Fixed icon display issues on Linux and Windows to ensure icons show correctly across different systems.
4. Desktop app enhancement: Supports window position memory, fixed external link jumping, automatic Windows system theme adaptation, and updated single-instance mode.
5. Brand new GitHub Actions workflow: Refactored quality testing workflows, added contributor update workflows, and full Release workflow support.
6. Build system optimization: Docker upgraded Rust base image to 1.82-slim, fixed cross-platform building issues, and optimized multi-stage build processes.
7. By the way, I officially reported a "Pake-plus" pirated version to GitHub, and they replied that they are handling it.

**Filo is an excellent email client**  
<https://www.filomail.com/>  
Filo is a very useful email client currently supporting Mac and iPhone. It's concise, beautiful, and the AI summary feature makes me feel that such functionality is truly great in this context. It's very user-friendly and highly recommended.

**Switched to open-source Mihomo Party**  
<https://mihomo.party/>  
Recently, I switched my Mac tools from paid software to the open-source Mihomo Party. The author updates frequently, leading to many interesting features. The visual design is great, it's a simple tool, and best of all, it solved my stability issues across various network environments.

**`networkQuality`: Check your Mac network speed with one command**  
<https://github.com/network-quality/community/wiki>  
Learned something: just enter the command `networkQuality` to check your Mac's network speed. No need to install any software or open a webpage. You can even set an alias `alias nq = "networkQuality"` for even easier use.

**macOS Sequoia lets you uninstall menu bar management tools**  
In the new macOS version, you can almost uninstall your menu bar management tools. There are two solutions: first, go to Settings and find the menu bar icon visibility settings; second, you can try dragging an icon directly onto the wallpaper to remove it. Previously only partially worked, but now it works for everything. Very convenient.
