## Trending Tools

**MiaoYan updated with new features**  
<https://github.com/tw93/MiaoYan/releases>  
Compatible with macOS 26. Friends who need it can download and overwrite the update. Added features: image link preview in the editor, support for dragging folders to change original order, three-pane layout drag to collapse/expand, and long PDF export no longer cuts content. It now uses the Tsanger JinKai font by default, and the package manager has been upgraded to Swift, etc.

**Addicted to Claude Code**  
<https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code>  
If you haven't used it yet, you must give it a try. It's expensive, but chatting and coding with her feels like being with an old friend—taking me back to the era when 30MB of data cost 5 RMB.

**LiYing: Automated processing flow for standard studio portrait ID photos**  
<https://github.com/aoguai/LiYing>  
This open-source project, LiYing, is interesting—a program for automated processing of standard photo studio post-production ID photo workflows. It can handle automatic recognition of human bodies and faces, automatic angle correction, automatic replacement of any background color, automatic cropping for any size ID photo, and automatic typesetting.

**OpenCut: An open-source video editor similar to CapCut**  
<https://opencut.app>  
Found an open-source video editor similar to CapCut, quite exquisite and simple, featuring timeline-based editing, multi-track support, real-time preview, etc. Give it a try if needed.

**TrackWeight: Use your Mac trackpad as a scale**  
<https://github.com/KrishKrosh/TrackWeight>  
The idea is brilliant: use your Mac trackpad as a scale, utilizing the built-in Force Touch pressure sensor to measure weight.

**Recent Good Movie: "To the Bright Side" (浪浪山小妖怪)**  
<https://movie.douban.com/subject/36438475/>  
It's good; friends can go watch it. It carries the bitterness of a worker amidst the laughter. It's been a long time since there was a cinema movie worth seeing.
