<small>The cover photo shows a tree laden with oranges I saw over the weekend. It felt very fruitful, though these oranges are more for show. I miss the thin-skinned green-to-yellow oranges from my childhood; they were delicious.</small>

<span style="color:#A67C52">Extra, extra, extra! Have you noticed that the Trending Weekly website has become more beautiful? My [blog](https://tw93.fun/) has also improved. I upgraded it over the weekend—trying new fonts, image click effects, and some detail work 🏂 </span>

## Trending Tools

**monotype: a minimalist typewriter writing app**  
<https://monotype.app/>  
Haha, this minimalist typewriter writing app monotype is quite interesting! Unfortunately, it doesn't support Chinese—it's pure English typing. The interaction is truly well-done, with sound effects that give a real sense of typing pleasure.

**Money Manager: Choosing Qianji in the end**  
<https://qianjiapp.com/>  
After switching to Android, I finally chose Qianji for bookkeeping. It's simple and plain, supporting almost all platforms. Just search the name in the app store to download. The author is generous; the free version's features are sufficient—no ads, no splash screen, no financial management lure. Give it a try.

**Kite: An AI-curated news site by Kagi**  
<https://kite.kagi.com/>  
Kagi launched an AI-curated news site, "Kite." Everything from choosing news to extracting summaries and translating into the user's specified language is done by AI. A quick look shows the quality is decent.

**Simple online photo collage tool**  
<https://img.ops-coffee.cn/photo/>  
This free online collage tool is very simple and has a plain beauty. All operations are performed locally in the browser, making it much more useful than some complex apps for quickly solving specific pain points.

## Just Looking Around

**DongCheDi's assistat driving safety test for new energy vehicles is worth watching**  
<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1vz8FzDEyE/>  
This assisted driving safety test for new energy vehicles by DongCheDi is well worth a look, especially for those wanting to buy a car. After watching, my confidence in investing in Tesla became even stronger. Looking at the comments: those with time can check the official websites of major insurance companies to see their quotes for some controversial models, then compare them with the video content—it's truly interesting.

**Looking at Fujifilm's recent new cameras in a store for you all**  
They are so beautiful! The first is the XE5, which can be thought of as a X100VI with interchangeable lenses, expected to be officially sold around August. There's also an expensive GFX 100RF, very textured and beautiful. Just playing around.
