<small>The cover image was taken over the weekend when I took my baby to Mogaoshan Kaiyuan Senbo for two days. It's very suitable for families, with excellent service. Staying by the lake in the mountains was very comfortable.</small>

## Made a visualization video to watch

[Pake](https://github.com/tw93/Pake) has just reached its 3rd anniversary since going open-source in 2022. It started as a tiny toy for "packaging WeChat Reading for desktop" and slowly turned into a usable little tool with 40K Stars. Many thanks to all the friends who contributed code and suggestions along the way.

This time, I used Gource to make another video of the commit records, set to my favorite music. Amazingly, it perfectly hit every milestone—quite magical. I recommend everyone to watch it until the end; you'll find it feels completely different from current AIGC-generated videos. The real-life timeline and sense of reality can never be replaced by AI.

In the past, when watching such videos, I focused on the evolution of the code. This time, I saw more of life's trajectory: sometimes bustling with many people around, sometimes peaceful as I moved forward slowly alone, resting for a while before catching up, and then new friends joining. Overall, it's not rushed or impatient, valuing long-term accumulation and continuous investment. Just doing what I love—how is that not an interesting life?

**You might find this feature of MiaoYan useful**
<https://github.com/tw93/MiaoYan>
MiaoYan has added a quick input feature: type a keyword + Tab to insert text instantly. It's quite suitable for lazy folks, supporting common commands like `table`, `markmap`, `mermaid`, `plantuml`, `video`, and `fold`. Most are common but tedious-to-type Markdown commands for engineers. You can find them in Menu Bar -> Format. Interested friends can give it a try, and there are other features to explore.

## Just Looking Around

**Elena Verna, Head of Growth at Lovable, shares growth strategy under AI**
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES0N6SKmF40>
This video is worth a look. Elena Verna talks about some problems with current traditional growth strategies and methods for user growth under a new generation of software. I agree with some of the methods mentioned. Of course, you can also read this [Chinese explanation](https://www.woshipm.com/operate/6282139.html), although I don't quite like the style of that article and prefer the original video.

**Simon's travel gear list after three years of backpacking**
<https://song.al/bag>
From an article by Simon, very well-written. I found some good things through this, like that nice-looking bag, and Patagonia and Flower Mountain shoes.
