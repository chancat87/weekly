<small>The cover photo was taken at Jeff Chang's concert at the Big Lotus in Hangzhou last weekend. The experience was great, and the songs were all catchy. Hearing Jeff Chang again as an adult, I suddenly felt he has a very "honest person" vibe, hahahaha. He's almost 58, but his voice is still beautiful.</small>

## Trending Tools

**Pake recently updated to version 3.0 🎉**  
<https://github.com/tw93/Pake>  
Sorry for the wait! I've updated Pake to version 3.0. It's a tool that lets you easily build lightweight cross-platform desktop apps with a single command. I've updated the dependency to Tauri 2, and the CLI and Actions are also upgraded to pave the way for mobile support. It now supports Proxy mode, single-instance mode, and is compatible with ChatGPT, Xiaohongshu, YouTube Music, and more. Give it a try!

**Awesome Cloudflare: Open-source tools collection**  
<https://github.com/zhuima/awesome-cloudflare>  
Found a collection of open-source tools based on Cloudflare. You can see many interesting things built on it—image hosting, email, blogs, short links, website analytics, and more. I bought some of their stock back when it was in the 70s as a way of support; looking back, it's quite interesting.

**PDFMathTranslate: AI bilingual PDF translation tool**  
<https://github.com/Byaidu/PDFMathTranslate>  
This AI bilingual translation tool for PDFs, PDFMathTranslate, is very good. it maintains the original layout and supports services like Google, DeepL, Ollama, and OpenAI. It offers CLI, GUI, and Docker versions. It's great for reading English papers—start with the translation and then read the original for faster comprehension.

**Applite: One-stop Mac software downloader**  
<https://aerolite.dev/applite>  
Most Mac software isn't available in the App Store; many are downloaded from official sites or GitHub. Applite is great—search and install with one click, saving the trouble of dragging into the Applications folder. You can also use it to discover good software or perform clean uninstalls. A true one-stop service.

**Wave Terminal: An interesting open-source terminal tool**  
<https://www.waveterm.dev/>  
Wave Terminal is quite interesting. it brings together various window components, allowing you to combine command lines, file previews, webpages, AI chat, and visualization components into your own workspace. A very interesting concept worth trying out.

## Just Looking Around

**Book Recommendation: "Poor Charlie's Almanack"**  
<https://book.douban.com/subject/35557542/>  
This book is excellent. Not just for Munger's investment advice, but more for his life philosophy and his straightforward character. He doesn't mince words—check out the quote below.

**DialectMap: Dialect Map Game**  
<https://dialect.quotemap.site/game>  
If you're interested in various regional dialects, you can play with this DialectMap. It collects dialects and folk songs from many places. You can listen and guess the location on the map—reminds me of what Wang Han from Hunan TV did to preserve local dialects. A great way to carry on tradition.

**Random Talk**  
The productivity boost from AI doesn't necessarily liberate laborers; as long as exploitation exists, capitalists will tend to extract more surplus value, making workers even more tired.
However, you can invest in AI-related US stocks, placing yourself above the capitalists and making them work for you.
