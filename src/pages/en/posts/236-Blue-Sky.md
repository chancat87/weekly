## Trending Tools

**Simplified my GitHub profile**  
<https://github.com/tw93>  
I've simplified the information display on my GitHub profile and changed my avatar. The statistics and "Code · Write · Share" content continue to be updated automatically every hour via GitHub Actions. Friends who need this logic can check the source repository. If you like it, feel free to follow my account for more product release updates.

**If you use Claude Code, try the "ccusage" tool**  
<https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage>  
If you use Claude Code, try `ccusage` to view your daily and monthly usage. It's very useful and convenient for seeing if your monthly subscription is worth it. Also, you can see your real-time Claude Code consumption by adding the following configuration to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "bun x ccusage statusline", // Use "npx -y ccusage statusline" if you prefer npm
    "padding": 0 // Optional: set to 0 to let status line go to edge
  }
}
```

**This ranking of GitHub users in China is interesting**  
<https://china-ranking.32k.site/>  
This ranking of Chinese GitHub users is quite interesting; it even includes a category for "Markdown Engineers." You can explore the developers there. However, I feel that ranking purely by followers is a bit simplistic; adding dimensions like community activity, Stars, Forks, and project contributions would be more interesting. Later, [stardev.io](https://stardev.io/top/developers/) was suggested, which has it all.

**Xcode 26 Beta 7 supports native Claude Code**  
<https://developer.apple.com/news/releases/?id=08282025a>  
Give it a try; it's decent. But Apple, you still need to hurry up and work harder on AI. Supporting Claude Code to this extent is already pretty good.

**Really like this style of online photo display**  
<https://photos.sambecker.com>  
I love the style of this online photo display. It supports both list and grid views and shows shooting parameters on the right. If you like taking photos, you can build a site like this to share. I'm planning to deploy one.

**Video from a few years ago by Xiao Lin on stock investing**  
<https://youtube.com/watch?v=xnIYIpXKvNM>  
Accidentally came across this video by Xiao Lin from a few years ago about stock investing. It shows how professional stock investors evaluate companies. Many points coincide with my own investment philosophies. I really like this perspective; beginners can take a look.

**When a "Vibe Coding" generated website goes live**  
Quoting yetone: when a Vibe Coding generated website goes live, I feel we'll see more and more of such sites in the future. It's so sad—I'm also quite sad. There are even many people feeling complacent, saying "programming is just like that."
