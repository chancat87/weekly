## Just Looking Around

**Movie Recommendation: "Maharaja" (2024)**  
<https://movie.douban.com/subject/36934908/>  
I watched "Maharaja" over the weekend. I haven't seen such a tightly-plotted, suspenseful movie with so many twists and timelines in a long time. definitely stay until the end. Highly recommended!

**What's the ultimate enjoyment in life?**  
Saw a picture online that perfectly captures this愜意 feeling: "In spring, there are hundreds of flowers; in autumn, the moon. In summer, there is a cool breeze; in winter, snow. If there are no idle things clinging to the mind, it is the best season in the world."
