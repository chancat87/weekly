<small>The cover photo was taken over the weekend in my residential area. Hangzhou’s spring is beautiful, but it’s quite short—it feels like winter just a month ago and it'll be short-sleeve weather next month. the current temperature is lovely, so it’s best to get out and enjoy it before the May heat sets in.</small>

## Just Looking Around

**Sam Altman’s Playbook for Startups**  
<https://jxp73q7qjsg.feishu.cn/docx/WCNZdKDa4o2eUrxK5ElcfBXEnah>  
A must-read. Success is built on a great idea, team, product, and execution. most people try to skip the execution part, but that's where the hard work happens.

**Selected Insights from the Playbook:**

- **Product**: Your primary goal is to make something people love. Successful companies ALWAYS start with this.
- **Team**: A great team is the foundation. Founders need grit, toughness, and resourcefulness. choose co-founders carefully—it's your most important decision.
- **Development**: focus on real user needs. stay simple and easy to use.
- **Execution**: keeping growth is the key. as CEO, focus on the vision and strategy, and hire people based on talent over just experience.
- **Growth**: it's the solution to all problems. focus on retention and revenue, not vanity metrics.
- **Competitors**: focus on your internal problems. Most startups die from self-inflicted wounds, not competition.
- **Profitability**: find a way for people to pay for your value. focus on unit economics and LTV.
