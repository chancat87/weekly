<small>The cover photo was taken in the neighborhood, where I saw a bayberry tree with some decent-looking fruit. It's been a long time since I've seen bayberries growing on a tree. As a child, we'd soak them in salt water first, then add sugar; I can already taste the sourness just thinking about it.</small>

## Trending Tools

**NewsNow: A news aggregation ranking platform**  
<https://newsnow.busiyi.world/>  
I prefer checking V2EX's "Hottest" and GitHub Trends; browsing them occasionally is quite fun.

**Google Colab for fine-tuning LLMs**  
<https://github.com/unslothai/notebooks>  
Someone has categorized and organized online running versions of Google Colab for current open-source LLMs. You can use these instructional notebooks to preprocess data, train, evaluate, and save your models.

**One-click website theme switching**  
<https://theme-toggle.rdsx.dev/>  
The one-click light/dark theme toggle effect on this site is great. Using the View Transitions API, you can just copy the code to use it, saving the effort of writing your own adapter.

**Proposal for standardization using `llms.txt` files**  
<https://llmstxt.org/>  
A proposal for using `llms.txt` files to provide information that helps LLMs use a website during inference. This is a great idea—original content is meant for people, but if it's for AI, do we need a separate version? I think it's very necessary.

## Just Looking Around

**How to evaluate the 2025 Gaokao English exam papers? How would you write this year's English essay?**  
<https://www.zhihu.com/question/1915084221267026167>  
An interesting question on Zhihu. Glad I don't have those exam-related dreams after starting work.

**If AI truly surpasses humans in coding and system design in the future, is it still necessary to learn them?**  
<https://baoyu.io/blog/ai-surpass-humans-coding-necessary>  
An article by Baoyu with two great quotes: "The time window for programmers won't be too short, and the window for architects will be long," and "No one knows what knowledge and skills will be needed in the future AI era, but those who keep learning will always be the fastest to keep up with trends."

**V2EX: Delivery logs from a night working for JD Meituan**  
<https://www.v2ex.com/t/1136194>  
The author tried being a delivery rider for a night in Shenzhen because of traffic issues making a personal car inconvenient. They recorded several things, including the surprising fact that you must pay a 3 RMB safety insurance fee every time you click "start work."

**10-year iPhone user trying an Android device**  
Wanting to avoid being trapped by the Apple ecosystem, I got an OPPO Find X8s, a small-screen Android phone. It feels great in hand, and the customization is very strong. However, a few apps don't adapt as well as on iPhone, but many features offer much more freedom. How long have you been an iPhone user? How long has it been since you touched an Android?
