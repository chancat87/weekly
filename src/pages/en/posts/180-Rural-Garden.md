<small>The cover photo shows a corner of a small vegetable garden next to the football field in our new office park. it's such an organic space with eggplant, calabash, chili, and tomatoes. you can pick them every month. I think when I'm older, I'd love to have a small, affordable piece of land to grow vegetables—it must feel wonderful.</small>

## Trending Tools

**If you use Raycast, try using it to replace multiple standalone apps**  
<https://www.raycast.com/>  
I'm now using `Color Picker` instead of a separate tool, `Uninstall Application` for software removal, `Window Management` for resizing, `Apple Music` for quick controls, `Clipboard History` for my clipboard needs, and `File Search` for quick lookups. Many great small tools—share yours!

**Email.ML: A super easy temporary email service**  
<http://email.ml/>  
Found Email.ML, a temporary email service running on Cloudflare. it generates a temporary address instantly—perfect for when you don't want to give out your real email.

**Public APIs: A collection of over 1000 public APIs**  
<https://publicapis.io/>

**mactop: Terminal-based monitoring for Apple Silicon**  
<https://github.com/context-labs/mactop>  
An open-source terminal tool that displays real-time metrics for Apple Silicon chips. it's a simple way to monitor CPU/GPU usage, E-cores, P-cores, and power draw. Setting an alias like `alias cpu="sudo mactop"` makes it even more convenient.

**Gifski: Free and open-source Video to GIF tool**  
<https://apps.apple.com/app/id1351639930>  
I've tried many, and Gifski is the best for high-quality GIFs. it's very easy to use. Tip: if your video quality looks poor on Twitter, try using a GIF instead—the result is often much better.

**Open Sans: A beautiful English font**  
<https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans>  
I love tweaking font rendering, weights, colors, and spacing. I noticed the English font on 01.ai looked great and found out it's Open Sans. it's designed with an "importance of honesty, open expression, and a neutral but friendly appearance." Give it a try.

**CodeEdit: Lightweight native Mac code editor**  
<https://www.codeedit.app/>

**Life Tip: Summer’s most refreshing low-sugar DIY drink**  
This is my favorite summer drink: 3 ice cubes, half a cup of soda water, half a cup of coconut water, and a few mint leaves on top. it's incredibly refreshing. highly recommended!

### Random Thoughts: A "Xianyu Man's" happy, money-saving weekend

Morning: I spent 58 RMB on Xianyu for a 4-hour JD cleaning service (usually 199 RMB). it happens when people have large vouchers or gifts. The cleaners still got their fair share, and the house is now spotless and professional.

Lunch: Haidilao for 178 RMB (usually 233 RMB) via Xianyu. A bit more complex to set up but well worth the meat.

Dinner: Nanjing Da Pai Dang for 50 RMB (usually 61 RMB) via Xianyu. Their Yangchun noodles are great.

Parking: 9 RMB for 4 hours (usually 32 RMB) via Xianyu. Fast and easy.

Next time, try Xianyu for movie tickets, car wash vouchers, or TV memberships. as long as it's a direct transaction on the platform (avoid those trying to move you to WeChat), the value is incredible.
