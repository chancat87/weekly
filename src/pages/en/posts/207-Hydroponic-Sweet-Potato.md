<small>The cover photo shows sweet potatoes I'm hydro-growing at home. They grow much better than many store-bought plants. Just toss a sweet potato in a cup with some water, leave it alone, and after a month it becomes a work of art. You should try it too.</small>

## Trending Tools

**Convert any webpage into a single HTML file with one command**  
<https://github.com/Y2Z/monolith>  
Found `monolith`, a tool that lets you package a webpage into a single standalone HTML file. It supports various installation methods and runs perfectly locally. It's much better than original browser saving, which creates multiple files and depends on network loading. Excellent experience.

**Bruno: An open-source API testing tool**  
<https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/>  
If you're looking for a Postman alternative, check out Bruno. I love how it uses a plain-text markup language called Bru to store API info, making it perfect for Git management. Lightweight and simple.

An interesting case: a guy lost his stolen camera because his AirTag ran out of battery. He built a versión using 2 D-cell batteries that can last for 10 years. Simple ideas solving big problems.
