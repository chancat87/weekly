<small>The cover photo shows a meal at mamala, a Western restaurant at Grand Canal Place in Hangzhou. it was less crowded than usual—maybe due to the extreme heat. The views from the second floor are great, and the food is excellent. Perfect for a special occasion.</small>

**Ice: A simple and useful Mac menu bar manager**  
<https://icemenubar.app/>  
Found a great, simple tool for hiding Mac menu bar items. it's much better than the rarely-updated Dozer or HiddenBar, and less complex than Bartender. I love that it can completely hide items you never want to see, and supports auto-show on hover. The developer is actively updating it.

## Technical Learning

**YouTube: Let's build GPT-2**  
<https://youtube.com/watch?v=l8pRSuU81PU>  
Andrej Karpathy's "Let's build GPT-2" is a must-watch. In this 124-minute video, he builds the GPT-2 network, optimizes training speed, and trains it using parameters from the GPT-2 and GPT-3 papers. Great weekend project.

## Random Notes

**K-Drama Recommendation: "The Sound of Your Heart"**  
<https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/26435723/>  
A hilarious Korean drama with a 9.2 Douban rating. Probably the funniest K-drama I've ever seen. Each episode is under 30 minutes, 10 episodes in total. Perfect for a weekend binge.

**Funniest video I've seen lately**  
<https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/665003330000000015011f29>  
Found this series "Can you marry this boy?" by "Wang Wang Cousin" on Xiaohongshu. Very funny, though I recommend just taking it as comedy.
