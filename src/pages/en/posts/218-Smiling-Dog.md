<small>The cover photo was taken at Machetouzu. It was a bit crowded; I feel camping at Jingshan Flower Sea is more comfortable. This dog was at the village camping site—very cute, it can smile! Playing with it was fun.</small>

**uBlock Origin Lite: Lightweight ad-blocker extension**  
<https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?pli=1>  
Since uBlock Origin cannot be used due to Manifest V3 changes, I found a workaround: try uBlock Origin Lite. It's a lightweight version with simpler features but still works well and uses very little memory. Waiting for more updates.

**How to ignore extension version limits in Chrome**

Since old Manifest V2 extensions are restricted, you can enter `chrome://flags/` in Chrome, search for `manifest versions`, and change "Default" to "Enabled" to enable Manifest V2 compatibility. Thanks to the author.

Learned a lot about risk control. In the dark forest of blockchain, remember these two safety rules: "Zero Trust" (always stay skeptical) and "Continuous Verification" (you must have the ability and habit to verify what you suspect).

Great stuff! A table of keyboard shortcuts on Wikipedia, definitely many more than you'd expect, including system-specific, text editing, and window management shortcuts. It's also a great reference for setting up shortcuts in your own software.
