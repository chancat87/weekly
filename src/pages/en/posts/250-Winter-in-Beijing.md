<small>The cover image was taken from a tree in Beijing. It's been a long time since I've been to Beijing. I happened to come here over the weekend as an invited speaker for AICon. The winter in Beijing is really cold with a bit of a breeze, and the trees are bare, giving a very different feeling from the south.</small>

**Johnny.Decimal, this life management method is interesting**
<https://johnnydecimal.com/>
Johnny.Decimal, this life management method is interesting. It's a system that uses "numbering + indexing" to organize all your materials/items. The idea is to assign a unique number to everything in your life or work, and then use a master index to link the number with the content location. It's quite suitable for "J" personality types. You can understand it as folder naming conventions + personal information management (PKM) indexing method + a set of strongly constrained classification frameworks.

**Andrej Karpathy's advice for college students on how to get good grades in courses**
<https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/advice.html>
This advice Andrej Karpathy wrote for college students on how to get good grades in courses is very good. I wish I had seen this when I was in school. It's equivalent to telling you tips on how to get high scores in exams, and of course, it's also suitable for students at all stages.

Don't stay up late, attend recitation/review classes, make a review plan, look at past exam papers. Learn by yourself in the early stage, and review with others in the later stage. Don't just hang out with people stronger than you; learn with students who are a bit weaker. You'll be forced to explain, and "teaching others" is very helpful for understanding. Also, do high-intensity sprints before the exam.

When taking the exam, use a pencil to answer. Scan all questions quickly first, do the easy ones first, keep the paper clean, never hand in the paper early, pay attention to the score for each question, don't spend too much time in the wrong direction. In the last 5 minutes, if there are still stuck places, you must stop. The most valuable thing in the last few minutes is to check from start to finish whether you missed any sub-questions, units, conclusions, or answers.

The final advice given is also quite good, which is to not focus too much on grades. Unless your grades are very poor, basically no one will care about your grades. After improving yourself to a level where it's not easy to fail an exam, you should turn your attention to more important things, gain real-world experience, such as internships, doing side projects, etc.

**AICon Sharing Scene**
The share was "The Breakthrough and Development of the New Generation of Engineers". I'll share the document version later. The official site took some interesting photos.
