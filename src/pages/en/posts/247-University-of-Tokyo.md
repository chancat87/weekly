<small>The cover image was taken at the huge ginkgo tree inside the University of Tokyo. It feels very special. Last week, I made a trip to Tokyo specifically to take a cover photo for the weekly and to share some experiences from the journey with everyone.</small>

## Trending Tools

**Mac Cleanup Tool Mole Updates to 1.11**
<https://github.com/tw93/Mole>

1. Cleanup speed has become much faster; the scanning algorithm has been optimized. Protection rules are also more complete—renv, JetBrains family, and OpenVPN configurations will not be accidentally deleted.
2. Gospel for Vim users: all menus can now be navigated using h/j/k/l.
3. `analyze` supports refreshing, all list heights automatically adapt to the terminal window, and the `optimize` command no longer deletes Finder cache, so your window positions and sidebar settings will be preserved.
4. Password input is more reliable; fixed issues like being unable to enter the password after waking from sleep (lid closed), Intel CPU errors, and iTerm2 freezing on exit.
5. Code-wise: The 1000+ line cleanup script has been split into 7 modules, with health checks and security scans added, and 400+ new test cases written to improve stability.

## Just Looking Around

**You can donate to the Tai Po fire emergency relief in Hong Kong**
<https://yanchai.org.hk/fire-incident-tai-po>
I've liked Hong Kong since I was a child; I love Hong Kong music and films. I hope for a quick recovery and safety. If you also want to contribute, you can visit the donation page of Hong Kong Yan Chai Hospital.

**Thoughts on AICoding**
Writing code by hand is for the texture and aesthetic of the creation itself, while AI Vibe Coding is used to automate parts I already wish were finished, so I can save my time for things I truly want to invest my heart in.

**The retrospective document for the November 18, 2025 Cloudflare outage is worth reading**
<https://blog.cloudflare.com/zh-cn/18-november-2025-outage/>
I've always felt that retrospective documents from foreign companies are written very well. In contrast, there's a bit of a "don't wash dirty linen in public" feeling domestically, and things are often not clearly explained. This company is much more forthright than Anthropic. The primary cause was "it was not any type of cyberattack or malicious activity that directly or indirectly triggered this issue. Instead, it was triggered by a permission change in our database system, which caused the database to output multiple entries to a 'feature file' used by Cloudflare's bot management system. As a result, the size of this feature file doubled. Subsequently, this larger-than-expected feature file propagated to all computers that make up the Cloudflare network."

**Talking about this trip to Japan**

This trip to Tokyo, Japan was a bit different from 23. I booked the flight and hotel a month ago. Before departure, Sanae Takaichi's comments broke, and there was internal panic about going to Japan. Some companions also cancelled their tickets; flight cancellations were free, but hotels basically required negotiation with Japanese merchants.

Since I booked a hotel package, it was even harder to cancel. If I cut my losses for several thousands, it would be hard to swallow, and I didn't want my plans to be disrupted. Based on several previous experiences in Japan, I judged there would be no issue. The service there is very friendly and kind. Last time I saw more about how [Japanese office workers are different from domestic ones](https://tw93.fun/2023-12-17/jp.html).

This time, because I traveled with a one-year-old baby, I paid more attention to infrastructure for people with limited mobility. I learned an experience: when traveling with a baby in Japan, you can choose accessibility mode for navigation in Google Maps. This way, all map routes have elevators, so you won't be in a sorry state carrying a stroller up and down stairs.

Accessibiity facilities are much more complete than I thought—perhaps due to being in a big city. Every mall has dedicated elevators for people with limited mobility (disabled, with babies, elderly), and there are also accessible-only restrooms, quite large, with facilities combined for mother and baby.

In the subway, you see some people living at lower levels, but they look quite clean, sitting there doing their own things. It reminds me of a saying: the level of development of a place should be seen by whether the lower-level people live with dignity. The group of people I saw live with great dignity. The accessible routes on the road are very clear, not blocked by things, nor just for show. The Braille on elevators is all there, so traveling should not be a big problem.

Last time in Ginza, you could hear many people chatting in Chinese. This time I found far fewer Chinese people—perhaps many worried and cancelled before departure. Instead, many Thai people were shopping manically, and there were also many Europeans and Americans.

None of the pre-departure worries occurred. It was still very friendly. Facing someone who doesn't understand Japanese, they would patiently listen to your non-fluent English with a smile. This experience is very comfortable for foreigners.

No politics, just life. Still hope for world peace and mutual kindness. This way, it would be much more convenient for ordinary people to explore more possibilities, and for foreigners to come to China to see various beautiful scenery and different lives would also be much simpler.
