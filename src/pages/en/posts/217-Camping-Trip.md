<small>The cover photo was taken while camping at the Jingshan Flower Sea in Hangzhou during the Qingming Festival. I bought a combined tent and canopy the day before the holiday; it's quite useful and easy to set up. This place is great for camping—not too crowded, with mountains, water, flowers, and grass—very comfortable.</small>
