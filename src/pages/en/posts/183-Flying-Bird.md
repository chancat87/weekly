<small>The cover photo was taken last week by West Lake. This "E-person" grandpa was skating with a speaker playing the Titanic theme song, looking so happy. it reminds me of Tang Dynasty's song "Flying Bird": "Everyone once longed to be a flying bird, traveling between the sky and the sun, flying over the endless long wilderness..." The only difference is the vibe—one soft, one bold.</small>

## Trending Tools

**TradingView: A solid financial tool**  
<https://cn.tradingview.com/markets/world-stocks/worlds-largest-companies/>  
If you're into learning personal finance, TradingView is very useful, especially for stock investors. you can clearly see world stock rankings and multi-dimensional analysis, like the "World's Largest Companies by Market Cap." I often use it to analyze stocks I'm interested in from a scientific perspective before buying.

**whats.new: A new type of address bar shortcut**  
<http://whats.new/>  
Google's `whats.new` service is a fantastic idea. `js.new` creates a new JS project on CodeSandbox, `docs.new` opens a new Google Doc, `sheets.new` for spreadsheets, and `gist.new` for code snippets.

## Random Notes

**Jensen Huang’s Caltech Commencement Speech**  
<https://youtube.com/watch?v=Sc48ToLIQAY>  
Watched Jensen Huang's Caltech speech on YouTube. He shared insights on AI, Nvidia's transition, and some life lessons. Very grounded and worth watching.

**Reading Notes: "置身事内" (Being Systemic)**  
<https://tw93.fun/2024-06-30/china.html>  
Just finished "Being Systemic - The Chinese Government and Economic Development." it's a great book to read twice. I spent some time consolidating some key points into my blog.

## Selected Insights from "Being Systemic"

1. Economic development is often lagging in areas at administrative borders (especially provincial ones).
2. China's population distribution is highly uneven. If you draw a line from Heihe to Tengchong, the east has 43% of the land but 94% of the population.
3. Power is essentially the question of who makes the call when things are unclear.
4. Fiscal matters are never just purely economic; they follow the flow of government intent and resources.
5. "Land Finance" isn't just about selling land; it's about the industrial and commercial activity attracted after development.
6. Urbanization often focuses on land over people. When we forget that urbanization should serve people and create better environments and incomes, it goes astray.
7. Real estate is often called the "mother of economic cycles" because it connects banks to the wealth and consumption of millions of families.
8. Accumulated wealth gaps are generally much larger than annual income gaps because those with wealth have more ways to accumulate it and better tools to manage risk.
9. Housing is the anchor of wealth for Chinese people, while financial assets are the anchor for Americans. This explains many basic policy differences between the two nations.
10. Policy tools must evolve because government capabilities and market conditions are always changing. Understanding the true development history of developed nations is often more instructive than abstract theories like the "Washington Consensus."
