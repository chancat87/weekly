<small>The cover photo shows ginkgo trees in front of the West Lake Apple Store during the weekend. The ginkgo in Hangzhou is very beautiful this season, especially when the sun shines on them against a blue sky. It's suddenly become quite cold lately, feeling like summer turned into winter overnight.</small>

## Just Looking Around

**V2EX: A developer transitioning to becoming a miner**  
<https://www.v2ex.com/t/1095904>  
I initially thought it was about crypto mining, but the photos were a shock—actual coal mining. Quite touching: 2,713 applicants for 500 spots, fitness tests, political reviews, and physicals. Finally succeeded and ranked 97th to "go down the mine." Not easy.

Saw Li Zhi's recent live performance on YouTube—singing Yu Dong's "Radio Beijing" but changed to "Radio Nanjing." Keep believing in the future and stay rational!
