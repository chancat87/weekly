<small>The cover photo shows the scene of me going out to take photos with my new Fujifilm XE5 over the weekend. Haha, I specifically took it to be the cover photo for the Weekly. I really love the texture, and the photos straight out of the camera are very pleasing. In short, I love this little toy.</small>

## Just Looking Around

**onevcat's thoughts after one and a half months of high-intensity Claude Code use**  
<https://onevcat.com/2025/08/claude-code/>  
onevcat's thoughts after high-intensity Claude Code use for a month and a half are very touching. Especially in the era of "vibe coding," don't let tools drive you to your limit. Efficiency is improved, but humans are still humans; we need more than just faster development speed—we need time for reflection and space for life.

## Random Thoughts

**Thoughts on the impact of AI Coding on programmers.**

<img src="https://cdn.fliggy.com/upic/wnoOST.png" width="800" />  

After spending $326 on Claude Code in less than a month (actually used $20 Pro + $50 top-up), Cursor, which I used for several months before, has become "old news." Used well, AI can easily reach the level of a Senior (P6+) Engineer. As an engineer, I feel both pleasantly surprised and a bit afraid.

The surprise is that AI Coding capability is truly strong. It has basically solved technical problems in non-front-end areas that I couldn't solve or implement well in recent years, through continuous communication and debugging. It’s like playing a game where you’re happy to pay for equipment—I’m very willing to give money to Anthropic because it genuinely surprises me, acting more like a technically brilliant and kind expert friend. In the future, "solo operation" in the hands of students who know tools, use their brains, and understand user needs will truly feel like having an exceptionally cost-effective team.

The fear is that the "ancient manual coding" I once felt confident in has become insignificant before today's AI. There's a cruel but clear trend: pure coding ability is no longer a programmer's moat. Current AI can easily replace programmers who are just "requirement translators." This is the scary part, coupled with the internet industry currently being in a "cost reduction and efficiency improvement" quagmire, which will accelerate this change.

I remember sharing two years ago about [the breakthrough for the next generation of engineers](https://tw93.fun/2023-10-25/new-fe.html): becoming a "Product Engineer"—knowing where users have needs and independently using a good product solution to meet them, while ensuring the product is easy to use, and being good at operation and promotion. Back then, AI Coding was still weak; today, it should be about being a Product Engineer who makes good use of AI.

For the next generation of great engineers, coding ability only accounts for a 30% advantage. There's 20% in quickly discovering and understanding the nature of business needs (knowing "why"), 20% in architectural design (like an architect telling AI what is needed and the frontend/backend architecture to ensure better implementation), 10% in clearer communication with AI so its execution fits your intent, and 20% in controlling final product quality and operations. Even good wine fears the deep alley—no matter how great AI is, it's still limited by the user who doesn't tinker.

I feel that AI Coding brings engineers more than just a lift in work efficiency—it's a multiplier. But that's not the key; more importantly, it allows one to quickly handle more complex product thinking and technical decision-making, accelerating the verification of business iteration ideas. It’s moving from being a code laborer to being a digital product architect. Aesthetics will become even more important in today's software design and engineering. If there's one more great ability a modern engineer needs, it's product design and aesthetics—which is why it's easy for clever designers to transition to engineering.

However, I dislike the promotion that makes "newbies" feel omnipotent with AI without understanding principles. Computer science fundamentals, software architecture, and interaction design are the foundations for an engineer, with or without AI. These cannot be lost; what needs more cultivation is the ability to build products.

Perhaps the qualitative change hadn't arrived before, but Claude Code makes me feel it has. Purely reskinning another's model for an editor won't last long; it’s slowly becoming a competition of "Model-as-a-Product" capability. Furthermore, for individuals, another way to enjoy the convenience of AI is to invest in it.
