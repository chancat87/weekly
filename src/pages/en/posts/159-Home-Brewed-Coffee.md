## Technical Learning

**Python Guide for JavaScript Engineers**  
<https://luckrnx09.com/python-guide-for-javascript-engineers/zh-cn/>  
A great Python primer for JS devs. it uses a comparative approach: first showing how to do something in JS, then re-implementing it in Python to highlight the differences.

**The Cost of Owning a Tesla in the US**  
<https://geekplux.com/posts/cost-of-tesla>  
An interesting breakdown by GeekPlux. `Cost = $43000 (Ouch) + $1390 + $200 + $3225 - $7500 (Potential Tax Credit) = $40315`. Seems reasonable.

**Trending Papers in Computer Science**  
<https://trendingpapers.com/papers>  
A "GitHub Trending" style site for computer science research. Perfect for staying up-to-date with new papers, especially in AI.

## Trending Tools

**Devv: An AI Search Engine for Developers**  
<https://github.com/devv-ai/devv/releases/tag/v0.1.0>  
Devv is much better at coding-related queries than traditional search. it helps you learn new domains quickly. I’ve partnered with them to package it as a desktop app via Pake—try setting a Raycast shortcut to summon it instantly.

**Bio Link: A Simple and Clean Bio Tool**  
<http://bio.link>  
After trying Bento (a bit too complex) and Linktree (not my aesthetic), I found Bio Link. it's minimalist and easy to use, with plenty of configuration options for your personal landing page.

## Snippets: "I Delivered Express in Beijing"

I've been reading this book before bed. The author is a delivery worker by day but a philosopher of life at heart. here are some highlights:

1. **On Freedom**: "Real freedom lies in what you are aware of, not what you enjoy. The more advanced your awareness, the harder it is to feel free in your work. Freedom is the personal pursuit of self-realization built on a highly developed self-consciousness."
2. **On Working to Live**: "Working purely for survival is as tragic as being in prison. Very few people admit they work solely for money—they claim interest, camaraderie, or fulfillment. But the older generation was more honest: they blindy saw labor as glory. Maugham was right: not everyone knows what to do with themselves once they don't have to worry about food."
3. **On Protecting Interests**: "My parents taught me to be kind, but never to defend my interests. I realized that a worker's rights are not a gift from the capitalist. if colleagues are unhappy with your rights, their conflict is with the employer, not you. I wish someone had told me this sooner."
4. **On Growing Up**: "I noticed my classmates changing the moment we entered society. They seemed to effortlessly shed their 'student' skin to become 'adults.' I felt like an onion—no matter how many layers I peeled back, I was still an onion."
5. **On Pleasing Everyone**: "Trying to please everyone is futile. You can never make an insincere person believe in your sincerity. Conversely, you don't need to prove your sincerity to a sincere person. hatred is blind; love is authentic."
6. **On Time**: "My time suddenly became abundant. I stoped seeing myself as a 30 RMB/hour delivery machine. I stARTED seeing my surroundings with fresh eyes—no longer driven by the anxiety and haste that used to blind me."
