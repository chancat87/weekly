## Trending Tools

**MoneyPrinterTurbo: One-click high-definition short video generation**  
<https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo>  
This open-source tool uses large AI models to generate HD short videos with one click. While video retrieval could be optimized, providing a topic or keyword allows it to automatically generate scripts, footage, subtitles, and background music, then synthesize them into an HD video.

**VideoLingo: One-stop video translation and localized dubbing tool**  
<https://github.com/Huanshere/VideoLingo>  
Domestic tools seem to be good at monetization. This one-stop video translation and localized dubbing tool generates Netflix-quality subtitles, moving away from stiff machine translations. It can also add high-quality cloned dubbing. (Please note copyright risks).

## Just Looking Around

**AI RaaS and AI "Contractor" Mode**  
<https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg5NTc0MjgwMw==&mid=2247516258&idx=1&sn=09aec44e46b8e7bf0dc995e0919a0444>  
The AI Contractor mode is divided into four evolution levels (L1-L4). L1 solves basic efficiency, L2 solves comprehensive efficiency, L3 achieves profit sharing, and L4 completes the qualitative change from passive to active—moving from serving to controlling resources. It maps AI's evolution from labor replacement to value creation.

**Illustrating Large Models: An easy-to-read LLM book**  
The most readable book on large models I've seen this year. It explains deep concepts simply with illustrations, making difficult parts instantly clear.
