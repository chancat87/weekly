<small>The cover photo shows my morning drink—delicious! Three ice cubes, three small cut limes, half a cup of soda water, and half a cup of pure coconut water. Try it—it looks and tastes great.</small>

A very easy-to-use tool for creating social media screenshots, similar to effects I've recommended historically. Just copy the URL, select the required social platform size, and it looks beautiful.

**WebVM: Virtual Linux environment running entirely in the browser**  
<https://webvm.io/>  
Found an interesting virtual Linux environment running purely in the browser using WebAssembly. It executes x86 binaries in a sandbox and is great as a teaching tool or for trying out Python, Vim, GCC, etc.

**Random Talk: YC's Pocket Guide for Founders**  
YC has a "pocket guide" for founders that is definitely worth revisiting from time to time to correct your course.

1. Launch now
2. Build something people want
3. Do things that don't scale
4. Find the 90/10 solution (90% problem, 10% solution)
5. Find 10-100 customers who love your product
6. All startups are badly broken at some point
7. Write code - talk to users
8. "It’s not your money"
9. Growth is the result of a great product, not the precursor
10. Don’t scale your team/product until you have built something people want
11. Valuation is not equal to success, or even probability of success
12. Avoid long negotiated deals with big customers if you can
13. Avoid big company corporate development queries - they will only waste time
14. Avoid conferences unless they are the best way to get customers
15. Pre-product market fit - do things that don't scale: remain small/nimble
16. Startups can only solve one problem well at any given time
17. Founder relationships matter more than you think
18. Sometimes you need to fire your customers (they might be killing you)
19. Ignore your competitors; you will more likely die of suicide than murder
20. Most companies don't die because they run out of money
21. Be nice! Or at least don’t be a jerk
22. Get sleep and exercise - take care of yourself
