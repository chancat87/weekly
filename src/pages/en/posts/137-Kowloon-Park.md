## Trending Tools

**Choosing a Mac Input Method**  
I’ve finally settled on my "input workflow" after years of jumping between apps.
On Mac: I've returned to the native Apple input method. With years of accumulated dictionary data and custom shortcuts, it’s remarkably fast. I use **Input Source Pro** to auto-switch to English in code editors and keep Chinese for everything else.
On iPhone: I've also moved back to the native keyboard after experimenting with Hamster/Rime. the native keyboard is faster to launch, perfectly integrates with system UI, and offers the best privacy protection.

**The Chinese Web Font Project**
