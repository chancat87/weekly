<small>The cover photo shows the Logitech MX Mechanical (Brown Switch) keyboard and MX Master 3s mouse I bought last week—both "For Mac" versions in white. The texture is excellent and the white is minimalist. However, as someone used to Mac's native keyboard and trackpad, I'm still adjusting—and it's not the easiest process.</small>

## Trending Tools

**iCraft Editor: 3D Architecture Diagram Tool**  
<https://icraft.gantcloud.com>  
Surprisingly, this 3D architecture tool iCraft Editor is free. It's well-designed and mature. Moving from 2D to 3D makes complex systems much clearer, and the results look far better than traditional tools.

**Raycast introduces Notes**  
<https://www.raycast.com/blog/raycast-notes?ref=producthunt>  
I initially thought it was a standalone app, but it's a new capability within the search bar. Just update to the latest version and search "Note." It follows the same search-driven style for writing, listing, and editing. Minimalist, lightweight, and elegant—perfect for quick notes.

**Top Calendar: Mac menu bar calendar**  
<https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/top-calendar/id1544980542>  
I've recommended Top Calendar before. It can replace the native menu bar date/time. Clicking it brings up your recent schedule and meetings. it was previously hard to find in the App Store, but it's available now.

## Just Looking Around

**Make it Yourself: DIY Projects**  
<https://makeityourself.org>  
The "Make it Yourself" e-book is fascinating, showcasing 1000 items you can DIY—chairs, telescopes, mice, lamps, etc. Each entry has blueprints and links to detailed tutorials. Perfect for makers.

**TikTok vs. Kuaishou**  
<https://www.woshipm.com/it/6138809.html>  
An interesting take on how domestic large model companies are advertising on short video apps. I think some companies might be focusing on the wrong things—spending that money on model optimization or infrastructure for the long term might be wiser.

**2024 Mouse Selection Guide**  
<https://sspai.com/post/93588>  
This sspai article echoes today's cover photo. There's also one on [picking keyboards](https://sspai.com/post/93631). Honestly, most Mac users eventually end up back with the Magic Keyboard and Trackpad. Hahaha.
