<small>The cover photo was taken over the weekend—fried small fish and shrimp with peppers. It was delicious and went perfectly with rice, really giving me the feeling of eating in my hometown as a child.</small>

## Trending Tools

**Scira: Open-source minimalist AI search engine**  
<https://github.com/zaidmukaddam/scira>  
An open-source version of Perplexity + DeepSearch tools. The UI looks good. You can try it out; it supports one-click Vercel deployment.

**WebAgent by Tongyi Lab**  
<https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/WebAgent>  
Tongyi Lab open-sourced a WebAgent for searching web information, including modules like WebWalker, WebDancer, WebSailor, and WebShaper. Besides the functionality, I quite like the naming. You can check out the effects.

**Color Palette Generator**  
<https://kigen.design/color>  
This color palette generator is perfect for my OCD. Input a color, and it automatically generates a batch of beautiful colors for you. I strongly suggest that students making AI websites stop using that blue-purple style—it's immediately recognizable as an AI-generated site and is quite ugly. Why not add some comfortable colors you actually like?
