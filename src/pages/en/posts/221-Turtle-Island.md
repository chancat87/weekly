<small>Last week during the May Day holiday in Qiandao Lake, I saw an island with a great feel on the mountain—it looks very much like a turtle. Took several photos.</small>

## Trending Tools

**AlgerMusicPlayer: A beautiful music player**  
<https://mc.alger.fun/#/>  
Found this beautiful music player on GitHub; it's very comfortable and supports multiple systems. I especially like the playlist design—great for discovering new music.

**Zen: System-level ad blocker similar to AdGuard**  
<https://zenprivacy.net/>  
Found Zen, a system-level ad blocker similar to AdGuard (sharing the name with an open-source browser). It’s not just a browser extension but a tool that blocks ads and privacy content across other software. Supports multiple desktop clients.

**LiveBench: LLM Benchmark tool**  
<https://livebench.ai/>  
LiveBench is a solid LLM benchmark tool. It limits potential test set contamination by regularly releasing new questions with verifiable, objective answers. Worth checking out when choosing a model. Qwen is doing great!

**Menu Bar Spacing: Adjust the gap between your menu bar icons**  
<https://sindresorhus.com/menu-bar-spacing>  
This Mac tool is perfect for those with OCD—it adjusts the spacing between your menu bar icons to make them tighter. I also recommend using "Ice" to hide unused icons for a cleaner look.

## Just Looking Around

**Tiny Watermelon at Xiaoxiang Supermarket is delicious**  
The "Hand-held Milk Tiny Watermelon" on Xiaoxiang Supermarket is delicious. It's not as huge as the ones at Sam's Club, perfect for two people. Thin skin, crispy fruit, very sweet. Even better after chilling in the fridge.

**Recently watching "Ming Dynasty 1566"**  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIzgZKgmt8A&list=PLUDHmjG40FQAHFN97qCbiy6skmcSSLm1m>  
Finally watching this 2007 drama. It's excellently filmed—a historical drama with a very high rating. YouTube has a 4K restored version without end credits.

**iPhone 16 Pro as low as 5,499 RMB after subsidies**  
<https://www.v2ex.com/t/1130942>  
Saw this on V2EX; never thought it would be so cheap with national subsidies. 128GB version at 5,499 is a steal on JD/Taobao. Some people are planning to expand the storage after the warranty expires. I'm actually looking forward to the 17 Air—wonder if there will be a very thin iPhone this year.
