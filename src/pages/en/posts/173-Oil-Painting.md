**New Post: Elon Musk Biography - Reading Notes**  
<https://tw93.fun/2024-04-14/musk.html>  
I've been reading Walter Isaacson's "Elon Musk" during my morning reading time. I highly recommend it to engineers. while his public persona on X is sometimes odd, the book reveals a true engineer at heart—someone who excels at merging technology, business, and cost control. here are my consolidated notes.

**New Post: My Minimalist Living Tips**  
<https://tw93.fun/2024-03-03/simple.html>  
I've moved an old post about minimalism to my blog. while I love this lifestyle, it's not for everyone—some people enjoy collecting or shopping, and that's perfectly fine as long as it brings you peace. but if you prefer simplicity, these tips might help.

**Whitepaper: How Converging Technologies will Drive Step-Changes in Economic Growth**  
<https://dub.sh/arkk>  
ARK Invest's whitepaper is worth a read. they argue that public blockchains, multi-omics sequencing, energy storage, robotics, and AI are converging to accelerate economic growth. useful for investment insights.

## Just Looking Around

**Book Recommendation: "Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity"**  
<https://m.douban.com/book/subject/36696538/>  
I've been reading "Outlive" and it's excellent. For engineers, having a healthy body and a happy mind is more important than almost anything else. longevity is only meaningful with high quality of life.

**Funny Changelogs**
