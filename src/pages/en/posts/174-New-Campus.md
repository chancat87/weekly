**Random Talk: Recommended noodle shops in Hangzhou**

I've always felt noodle shops in Lao Yuhang are better than the "Hangbang" style noodles in the city center, which I find too sweet.

Today I ate at **"Lao Tai Po Noodle Shop,"** a home-based shop in Lao Yuhang town. You just grab a table in the pavilion, pay, and wait for your handwritten number to be called. it's mostly locals. their eel noodles are a masterpiece—I usually add a poached egg on top.

**Here are a few more recommendations for those in Hangzhou:**

1. For eel or shrimp noodles: **Lao Tai Po**.
2. For "Pian Er Chuan": **Lao Jie Noodle Shop** near Sanba Metro Station.
3. For stir-fried noodles: **Cang Qian Couple Noodle Shop** (try the beef stir-fry with extra egg).
4. For soup noodles: **Mang Zhong** (their "San Xian" noodles are very generous).
