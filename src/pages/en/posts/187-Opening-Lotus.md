<small>The cover photo was taken over the weekend at a lotus field behind the Gexiang Metro Station parking lot in Hangzhou. The sunset lighting was fantastic. I captured lotuses in various stages: "I'm closed off," "I'm starting to open," and "I'm fully open." Hahaha, here's one almost fully open.</small>

**Random Talk: Using gaps to work efficiently and prioritizing important tasks**

I've developed a habit that works every time: using small gaps during chores to quickly finish upcoming tasks, and prioritizing things that cause the most anxiety. it saves time and feels great.

For example, while cooking, you can clean up the stove or rinse the dishes you'll need soon. After making coffee, immediately dump the grounds and rinse the portafilter instead of letting it sit. immediately washing your cup after drinking makes the final cleanup much faster and prevents tasks from piling up.

Similarly at work: identifies the urgent, important task that would cause anxiety if left until the last day, and just do it NOW. set a deadline, like "finish before leaving today," so you don't have to think about it tomorrow. your happiness level will increase significantly.
