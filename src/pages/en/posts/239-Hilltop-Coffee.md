## Trending Tools

**🎉 MiaoYan V2.0 "New Face" version is released!**  
<https://github.com/tw93/MiaoYan>  
MiaoYan, the Markdown notebook even more suitable for engineers, has been updated to V2.0, named "New Face."
This open-source product has been maintained for about 5 years, incorporating many of my own best practices for note-taking apps, such as shortcut key content switching, a native experience like a code editor, exporting various needed content, supporting writing house PPTs with Markdown, and supporting rich operations like LaTeX, Mermaid, etc. The updates are as follows:

1. Brand new icon design, clearer and more beautiful, with smoother theme switching.
2. Refined settings panel, optimized font and language settings, and finally support for custom fonts.
3. Supports top navigation and shortcut key operations—try the ESC/arrow keys to switch content more conveniently.
4. Optimized export results, generating more stable content with more exquisite typesetting.
5. Project fully upgraded to Swift 6, optimizing many code implementations and adapting to new features.
6. Asynchronous image uploading is smoother, preview performance is optimized, and the experience is more consistent under editing status.

**Try Tencent's Edge Security and Acceleration Platform: EdgeOne**  
<https://pages.edgeone.ai/zh>  
Recently, I've been trying Tencent's EdgeOne, which offers an excellent free public service for developers, somewhat similar to Cloudflare but easier to get started with. For small teams polishing an MVP, it's a great way to quickly launch and validate ideas.
What I like most is its "Pages" one-click deployment, which feels very similar to Vercel but with a larger quota. Linking the repository, compiling, deploying, and binding the domain takes basically 1 minute, and it comes with automatic HTTPS certificates. I deployed this Weekly on it, and the process was smooth with fast page loading.
EdgeOne Pages recently upgraded its full-stack capabilities, supporting Node.js, Next.js (SSR, ISR), and Node Functions, and even has a CLI for local debugging, making it feel more like a complete edge full-stack development platform. It's quite fun to play with.

**Ink: A library for writing interactive CLI tools with React**  
<https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink>  
The `vadimdemedes/ink` library on GitHub has a great idea: using React syntax to write interactive command-line tools. It’s a React renderer, so all corresponding syntax should be supported. Quite interesting.

**Found a useful tip on Mac: `caffeinate` ☕️**  
Give your computer some coffee to stay awake and not sleep. Sometimes you need to update or download things for a long time and worry that the screen will turn off or the computer will sleep. Try this command:
`caffeinate -d` prevents the display from turning off, `caffeinate -i` keeps the system from sleeping, and `caffeinate -t 1800` keeps it awake for 30 minutes. Very simple and easy to use.

## Just Looking Around

**Welch Labs YouTube channel with depth and theoretical background**  
<https://youtube.com/@WelchLabsVideo>  
If you like math, science, machine learning/AI, and prefer "How" and "Why" series, I recommend the Welch Labs YouTube channel. It has depth and theoretical background, and emphasizes historical and storytelling explanations. Each episode is about 20 minutes, using animation and hand-drawing to explain complex concepts. Very interesting.

## Random Thoughts

Listening to a podcast, they quoted a phrase from Master Hong Yi, which is worth recording:

"The most unfortunate thing in life is when a slip of the tongue occasionally occurs without causing trouble; when a plan occasionally fails but the task happens to succeed; or when a reckless act occasionally brings a small profit. Later, one regards these as normal and becomes indifferent and unconcerned. This is where the greatest misfortunes begin!"

In life's most unfortunate situations, sometimes you say the wrong thing but don't cause trouble; sometimes a plan is flawed but the task succeeds by luck; or you act recklessly and gain a small benefit. Consequently, you take this accidental success as normal and think it doesn't matter, and the greatest disasters grow from there.
