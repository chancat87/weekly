<small>The cover photo was taken on Saturday morning after sleeping until waking up naturally. The sun shone through the curtains, and I saw the shadow of Tangyuan the cat sunbathing on the cat tree on the balcony. It felt very atmospheric.</small>

**Talk: Breakthrough and Development of New Generation Engineers**
<https://tw93.fun/2025-12-22/engineer.html>
This is a talk I gave last week at AICon Beijing titled "Breakthrough and Development of New Generation Engineers - Transformation Practice from Positions to Capabilities." I've converted the PPT into an article and posted it here, hoping to provide some input for the new generation of engineers. I look forward to everyone's exchange.

**Mole reached 20K Stars! Thanks for your love for this release**
<https://github.com/tw93/Mole>
Mole, a tool that can clean up dozens of GBs at once, was born from the first line of code I wrote by the pool in Sanya during National Day. In less than 80 days, it went from 0 to 20K+ Stars, loved and recommended by developers worldwide. Thank you all for your support. Version 1.15 has been released with the following updates:

1. Startup and repeated scanning speeds increased by up to 10x, making daily use significantly faster.
2. Automatically skips network disks and adds timeout protection, making disk scanning more stable and less prone to lagging.
3. File permission policies tightened across the board to further avoid accidental operations affecting the system.
4. Added pnpm cache and Trash whitelist cleanup, making the cleanup scope more comprehensive and reassuring.
5. Terminal output and progress prompts fully optimized for a clearer and smoother experience.

**Menu Bar Tools for AI Coding Usage**
<https://codexbar.app/>
CodeyBar is a quite good Mac application. If you use coding tools like Codex, Claude Code, or Gemini, installing this allows you to easily see your usage and status from the menu bar. It's very convenient and necessary for me. Interested friends can give it a try.

**X (Twitter) Shadowban Checker F**
<https://x-shadowban-checker.fia-s.com/>
This X (Twitter) Shadowban Checker F is quite useful. Enter your user ID to determine if an account or a post has been shadowbanned/excluded from search/had replies folded. It can also serve as a reference point for whether an account is likely to be banned in the future.

**Open Source Mac Menu Bar Calendar: MacCalendar**
<https://github.com/bylinxx/MacCalendar>
This free and open-source Mac menu bar calendar, MacCalendar, is well-done. It feels somewhat inspired by the paid Top Calendar I recommended before. I still use Top Calendar myself and love it. It essentially puts your time, calendar, and schedule all in the menu bar, which is particularly suitable for office workers to see their schedule at a glance. Interested friends can check it out.

## Casual Browsing

**Loving Google's AI lately**
<https://one.google.com/referral/redeem/40HU8K8Z>
This is pretty good: invite friends to use Google AI Pro for free for 4 months. My favorite lately is Gemini; it's great for both chatting and coding. If this activity expires, you can look for other activities; they are usually quite cheap.

**How to Efficiently Clean Up Your iPhone System Data**
I checked and found that my iPhone's system data was actually 25GB. I found a method and cleaned up 8GB. Those in need can also try this.
First, force restart your iPhone: Volume Up → Release, Volume Down → Release, then long-press the Power button until the Apple Logo appears. Wait a while after restarting and check—you'll find a few GBs are gone.
Next, go to Settings → Apple ID → iCloud → iCloud Drive, then turn off iCloud Drive, restart again, and then turn it back on in Settings. You'll find a few more GBs are gone.
Finally, clear Safari & in-app caches: go to Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data; go to Settings → Safari → Advanced → Website Data → Remove All Website Data. This will also save a few GBs.
To clean up even more, I usually go through the apps of major domestic companies and use their built-in cache clearing, then uninstall apps I don't use often. Of course, the main culprit is always WeChat (where your understanding of the product is effectively 0), so you can continue cleaning that up.

**Recommending a delicious Sparkling Iced Americano**
Mix apple soda with an Americano and ice. It's very tasty, simple to make, and looks great. Later, I used Watson's Tonic Water instead, and it was also very delicious.
