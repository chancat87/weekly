## Trending Tools

**Recommended Apps for Bookkeeping and Asset Management**  
After trying several apps, I've settled on two that I highly recommend for tracking spending and assets:

1. **Cookie**: A beautifully designed, minimalist bookkeeping app for iPhone and Mac. The design details are very thoughtful and perfect for daily use.  
2. **Capivot**: A powerful asset manager that aggregates stocks, cash, and other investments. it automatically pulls stock prices and exchange rates, saving you from manual updates. I just update the total in Cookie every month.
