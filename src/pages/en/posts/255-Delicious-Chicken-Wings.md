**243 Engineers: Best Things Bought in the Past Year**
<https://tw93.fun/2026-01-24/good.html>
Last week, while buying Lunar New Year dinner gifts for the team, I casually asked on X: In the past year, what is the thing you were most satisfied with? Or if you had to recommend one item, what would it be? It could be gadgets, software, or daily-use items.
I did not expect 243 replies. It felt lively and real, and I really like this kind of exchange. The comments were buzzing. After reading through a few times, I found many great items. The recommendations ranged from must-haves to very down-to-earth everyday goods.

**Pake Updated to Version 3.8.1**
<https://github.com/tw93/Pake>
Pake, the tool that packages web pages into lightweight desktop apps for macOS, Windows, and Linux, has been updated. Changelog highlights:
1. Third-party login popups: Added the `--new-window` parameter to support OAuth/SSO flows that need a new window, wired through CLI -> config -> Tauri window.
2. Fullscreen video support: The injection layer adds HTML5 Fullscreen compatibility so sites like YouTube can reliably enter fullscreen.
3. Linux packaging expansion: Added RPM packaging and multi-target builds. The default Linux targets are now `deb` and `appimage`.
4. Linux stability and focus fixes: Disabled the WebKit DMABUF renderer by default for stability, fixed fullscreen input focus, and restored fullscreen correctly for tray launch and startup scenarios.
5. macOS window behavior: Closing a window no longer minimizes it; it hides instead. Window control permissions are completed, and reopening from the Dock restores hidden windows.
6. Theme and experience tweaks: Follow system theme by default, and only force light/dark mode when explicitly set.

**MemOS: Long-Term Memory for Agents and LLMs**
<https://github.com/MemTensor/MemOS>
While looking at long-term memory solutions for Agents and LLMs, I found an interesting project: MemOS. It is not about stuffing a bigger context window or improving retrieval, but about a more fundamental problem: how memory itself should be managed.
When building AI agents or multi-turn chat, models often forget context. User preferences, operation records, and uploaded documents seem to evaporate. MemOS addresses this with a core "shared memory layer," and lets the same memory be reused across projects and agents.
It supports connecting files and URLs directly into a knowledge base. During conversations, memories are continuously updated and gradually form preference memories as they grow. It can unify text, images, files, and tool calls under one management layer, and you can even use natural language to correct or clean existing memory when needed. If you are interested, go check out the project.

This unified AI interface in the terminal, Toad, is pretty good. With the ACP protocol, it is worth checking out and giving it a try.

An immersive 3D/2D web visualization project that explores the 200-million-year epic evolution of mammals. The interactions are excellent and great for anyone who likes "archaeology".

## Just Looking Around

**Watching Alex Honnold Climb Taipei 101 on Netflix Live**
<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nYzDB3EKx>
On Sunday morning, I watched Alex Honnold climb Taipei 101, a landmark in Taiwan, on a Netflix live stream. He free-soloed the whole way without ropes or safety gear; one mistake would have been fatal. He finished in about an hour and a half. I am really impressed, and he stayed remarkably calm throughout. It is worth watching. If you do not have Netflix, you can probably find it on Bilibili too. It has been a long time since I have seen something like this.
