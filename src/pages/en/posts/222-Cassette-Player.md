<small>The cover photo shows a Sony integrated cassette/CD player I found last week. I bought 10 cassettes; I really love the texture and the retro feel of listening to music this way. I love it so much—one cassette every night feels great.</small>

## Trending Tools

**Mastra: An elegant TS AI Agent framework**  
<https://mastra.ai/>  
This TS AI Agent framework, Mastra, is truly elegant. It's been a long time since I've seen such a beautiful and concise library. It provides a memory framework, workflow execution, RAG, etc. I feel that for building low-code versions of AI applications, we still need a ProCode version for engineers to develop more customized AI apps.

**Void: An open-source Cursor-like AI code editor**  
<https://github.com/voideditor/void>  
An open-source Cursor-like AI code editor. The interaction is very similar to Cursor; you can use any model, control your own data, and since it’s a VS Code fork, you can migrate configurations seamlessly.

**Yfinance: Simple access to Yahoo Finance stock API data**  
<https://ranaroussi.github.io/yfinance/>  
The Yfinance Python library provides simple access to Yahoo Finance stock data, including price queries and historical market data downloads. The API is quite clean, perfect for building little projects.

**Act: A tool for running GitHub Actions locally**  
<https://github.com/nektos/act>  
If you need efficient debugging for GitHub Actions, try `act`. It reads files in `.github/workflows/` and executes them locally, saving you from checking cloud changes for every modification.

## Just Looking Around

**"A Random Walk Down Wall Street": A great investment book**  
<https://book.douban.com/subject/10606457/>  
I've been reading this lately; it's a very readable investment learning book. Highly recommended!  
"Investors would be much better off if they simply bought and held an index fund based on a broad market index, rather than trying to buy and sell individual stocks or active management funds."

**How to improve product conversion while maintaining a good user experience?**  
<https://www.uisdc.com/ux-rights-balance>  
User guidance shouldn't be a "gentle trap" but a "clear invitation." Product design shouldn't be about "making you take the bait" but "making you willing to stay." In this era where experience is king and trust is scarce, designers should ask themselves: Is this path fair? Does the user understand and agree? Can they change their mind at any time? If the answer is "yes," you're doing "benign design."

**Working principle of a cassette recorder**  
<https://g.co/gemini/share/447c46b00acc>  
Learned about the principles of cassettes and cassette players through Gemini; it's better than what I found on Zhihu. Here are the cassettes I bought.
